[EOU] Wanting to take this nap might end up costing me to dear. [EOU] Hilary [SAYS] Oh come on 😂 [EOU] Benjamin [SAYS] All these terrible obstacles on mu way to bed might just prove to much to take. [EOU] Hilary [SAYS] We'll try to avoid talking about their subject of research. [EOU] Oh wait, no, I'm actually meeting them because I wanted to chat about their research lol. [EOU] Elliot [SAYS] 🙉 [EOU] Hilary [SAYS] Do join us, we're going to have fun. [EOU] And then you'll take the keys and take this most deserved of naps.

Clara [SAYS] Hi, what you up to? [EOU] Neela [SAYS] Not much, chilling out. [EOU] Clara [SAYS] Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍 [EOU] Neela [SAYS] Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? [EOU] Any good? [EOU] Clara [SAYS] Well, yes! [EOU] I just said it was, LOL. [EOU] It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence. [EOU] Neela [SAYS] Why is it called Dear White People? [EOU] Clara [SAYS] That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio. [EOU] Neela [SAYS] Yeah, but why is it so good? [EOU] Clara [SAYS] Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. [EOU] The characters are strong and likeable too. [EOU] Neela [SAYS] I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then? [EOU] Clara [SAYS] It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. [EOU] It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand. [EOU] Neela [SAYS] How's that? [EOU] Clara [SAYS] Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. [EOU] It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that. [EOU] Neela [SAYS] Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. [EOU] What else happens? [EOU] Clara [SAYS] Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. [EOU] He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies. [EOU] Neela [SAYS] Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon! [EOU] Clara [SAYS] Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it! [EOU] Neela [SAYS] Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People. [EOU] Clara [SAYS] Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4! [EOU] Neela [SAYS] See ya, love! [EOU] Clara [SAYS] Bye! [EOU]

Deirdre [SAYS] Hi Beth, how are you love? [EOU] Beth [SAYS] Hi Auntie Deirdre, I'm been meaning to message you, had a favour to ask. [EOU] Deirdre [SAYS] Wondered if you had any thought about your Mum's 40th, we've got to do something special! [EOU] Beth [SAYS] How about a girls weekend, just mum, me, you and the girls, Kira will have to come back from Uni, of course. [EOU] Deirdre [SAYS] Sounds fab! [EOU] Get your thinking cap on, it's only in 6 weeks! [EOU] Bet she's dreading it, I remember doing that! [EOU] Beth [SAYS] Oh yeah, we had a surprise party for you, you nearly had a heart attack! [EOU] Deirdre [SAYS] Well, it was a lovely surprise! [EOU] Gosh, thats nearly 4 years ago now, time flies! [EOU] What was the favour, darling? [EOU] Beth [SAYS] Oh, it was just that I fancied trying a bit of work experience in the salon, auntie. [EOU] Deirdre [SAYS] Well, I am looking for Saturday girls, are you sure about it? [EOU] you could do well in the exams and go on to college or 6th form. [EOU] Beth [SAYS] I know, but it's not for me, auntie, I am doing all foundation papers and I'm struggling with those. [EOU] Deirdre [SAYS] What about a tutor? [EOU] Kira could help you in the hols. [EOU] Beth [SAYS] Maybe, but I'd like to try working. [EOU] I'm 16 soon, I'm old enough. [EOU] Deirdre [SAYS] I know. [EOU] Look, pop in tomorrow after school and we'll have a cuppa and a chat. [EOU] Beth [SAYS] Yes, thanks auntie. [EOU] I'd really like to try the beauty therapy side. [EOU] Deirdre [SAYS] Its not for the squeamish, mind. [EOU] Massage, pedicures, not to mention waxing! [EOU] Beth [SAYS] Oh yes, I was chatting to a friend about it yesterday! [EOU] Deirdre [SAYS] Maxine manages the beauty side, you can meet her tomorrow and we'll see how it goes. [EOU] Beth [SAYS] Yes, I'd really like that. [EOU] Deirdre [SAYS] We can try a few hours on a Saturday for a couple of weeks as work experience. [EOU] I'll give you a tenner or so per session to start off for your lunch, coffee and bus fare etc. [EOU] If you like, we'll take it from there. [EOU] Beth [SAYS] OK, I like the sound of it! [EOU] See you tomorrow Auntie! [EOU] Love you! [EOU] Deirdre [SAYS] Bye, lovely girl! [EOU] Xx [EOU]
Gloria [SAYS] This exam is a bit of a lottery in fact [EOU] You can't really get prepared, it's all about experience. [EOU] Emma [SAYS] But there are some rules and some typical texts right? [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] You can see some texts from previous years [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] Emma [SAYS] Wow that's very useful [EOU] I have never seen this site. [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] Yes it's very good [EOU] Actually it's good to read all the texts because you will see that some phrases repeat very often. [EOU] Emma [SAYS] How much time do you have for all 4 parts? [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] 4 hours. [EOU] Emma [SAYS] Is it enough? [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] Well it has to be [EOU] Would be perfect to have 2 more hours... [EOU] But on the other hand it would be really exhausting. [EOU] Emma [SAYS] 4 hours and no breaks? [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] No breaks :/ So it's really important to be really focused and try to write as fast as you can [EOU] And read it carefully and correct during the last hour. [EOU] Emma [SAYS] I'm going to read everything from that website, it's great [EOU]
Adam [SAYS] Have you talked to May? [EOU] Karen [SAYS] Yes, yesterday, why? [EOU] Adam [SAYS] I just talked to her and I must admit I worry about her. [EOU] Karen [SAYS] Me too, I suggested she should see a specialist, but she wasn't very happy about it. [EOU] Adam [SAYS] No wonder... [EOU] Karen [SAYS] I know, but I think this is serious. [EOU] She's saying she's depressed, like everyone around, but in her case it may be true. [EOU] Adam [SAYS] She was telling me she doesn't feel like doing anything, she's bored all the time, she never feels happy. [EOU] It sounds like a real, typical depression [EOU] She also told me that she has trouble sleeping. [EOU] I asked her to go out for a beer or anything basically, but she doesn't want to leave the flat. [EOU] Karen [SAYS] Oh my, it sounds really serious. [EOU] I don't what to tell you. [EOU] Adam [SAYS] I was wondering how I can help her. [EOU] Karen [SAYS] Honestly I don't know if we can help her, Adam. [EOU] I suggested a specialist because these are very sensitive issues and I'm afraid we may unintentionally make it worse. [EOU] Adam [SAYS] Yes, but she doesn't want to see a specialist. [EOU] Basically, she doesn't want to see anyone. [EOU] Karen [SAYS] Hm... [EOU] I don't know... [EOU] How about I call someone for advice? [EOU] So we could know what to do. [EOU] Adam [SAYS] Sounds rational, do you know anyone you could call? [EOU] Don't mention her name. [EOU] Karen [SAYS] Of course I won't! [EOU] I have a friend who's a psychologist, we can trust her. [EOU] I'll let you know. [EOU] Adam [SAYS] Thank you Karen! [EOU]
Anne [SAYS] You were right, he was lying to me :/ [EOU] Irene [SAYS] Oh no, what happened? [EOU] Jane [SAYS] who? [EOU] that Mark guy?

Jesse [SAYS] I have an idea that'll cheer u up! [EOU] Melvin [SAYS] What is it? [EOU] Jesse [SAYS] I was thinking about doing something 4 the less fortunate this year. [EOU] Lee [SAYS] Gr8 idea! [EOU] Anything in mind? [EOU] Maxine [SAYS] So no presents 4 me? [EOU] :( [EOU] Jesse [SAYS] U'll get ur presents, no worries ;) [EOU] Maxine [SAYS] Phew! [EOU] Was getting a bit worried for a moment ;) [EOU] Melvin [SAYS] Bt what do u have in store? [EOU] Jesse [SAYS] Well, have u heard about the Refuge? [EOU] Lee [SAYS] No. [EOU] What's that? [EOU] Melvin [SAYS] That's the Christmas foundation to help women and children? [EOU] Maxine [SAYS] I think I've heard of them. [EOU] So what about them? [EOU] Jesse [SAYS] That's right! [EOU] They help women and children who escape from abuse. [EOU] And every year they post wish lists of such ppl online and I thought that we could choose one and chip in. [EOU] Melvin [SAYS] That's a great idea! [EOU] Lee [SAYS] Count me in! [EOU] Maxine [SAYS] Me too. [EOU] Jesse [SAYS] Have a look at these 3 lists: <file_other> <file_other> <file_other> [EOU] Lee [SAYS] I think the second one would be the easiest to arrange. [EOU] Maxine [SAYS] Agree. [EOU] Melvin [SAYS] What about number 3? [EOU] A bit ambitious, but if we pull together, we'll manage. [EOU] Jesse [SAYS] Actually, I'm in for the 3rd one. [EOU] Maxine [SAYS] I think the 2nd list would be better. [EOU] The items cos more or less the same and we can easily divide it. [EOU] Melvin [SAYS] But if we agree to chip in the same amount of money, we can deal with the 3rd one easily. [EOU] Lee [SAYS] Come to think of it, the 3rd one is not that bad. [EOU] A bit of planning and logistics and were good to go. [EOU] Jesse [SAYS] So it's settled? [EOU] Melvin [SAYS] Yup. [EOU] Lee [SAYS] Sure. [EOU] Maxine [SAYS] Fine. [EOU]

[EOU] Kate [SAYS] And if you go to some boutique shop or something? [EOU] Not at a market as in your pics? [EOU] Ola [SAYS] I might try and find some. [EOU] Would you like one too? [EOU] Kate [SAYS] Not really. [EOU] And Mum would prefer to be the only one with an authentic Cuban blouse :)) [EOU] Ola [SAYS] OK I'll have a look. [EOU] Greets to everyone at home pls.

[EOU] Maxwell [SAYS] Wait, I heard there was some problem with Marcus at school… [EOU] Jeanice [SAYS] Nothing very serious, he argued with a friend but they didn’t fight. [EOU] Maxwell [SAYS] Oh, ok, the teacher sounded like it was something terrible. [EOU] Jeanice [SAYS] In a way it was, he didn’t want to stop when a teacher reacted and he was pretty aggressive. [EOU] Maxwell [SAYS] That’s worse… Have you noticed him behaving in a strange way recently? [EOU] Jeanice [SAYS] Not at all, cute as usual. [EOU] But… he gets very angry for stupid reasons.

[EOU] Leah [SAYS] last night i went to the poetry reading [EOU] this guy approached me, introduced himself and we started talking [EOU] he was rly boring, but, you know, i didn't want to be rude, he didn't seem to be a psycho, so i kept talkig to him [EOU] at one point he mentioned that "we have something in common", because we both speak german. [EOU] Samantha [SAYS] charming :D [EOU] Leah [SAYS] i was like: "erm, ok, how do you know about this, i don't know you, i didn't tell you about this" [EOU] he just brushed it off and kept talking [EOU] at one point he asked me about an event i had attended and he NAMED ALL OF MY FRIENDS THAT HAD COME WITH ME [EOU] of course i didn't tell him about it. [EOU] Samantha [SAYS] wow, that's creepy as hell [EOU] what did you do? [EOU] Leah [SAYS] i asked him once again how did he know about all this stuff and he said that he googled me out. [EOU] Samantha [SAYS] WHAAAAT? [EOU] i googled people out before, but i’m not that stupid (and creepy) to tell them about it :o. [EOU] Leah [SAYS] right?! [EOU] and now the best part [EOU] he googled me out, because he thought that i had a crush on him, because 2 weeks earlier I LIKED A POST ON FB announcing that he was going to accompany poets on the guitar during the poetry reading [EOU] can you believe this?! [EOU] Samantha [SAYS] LOOOOOOL [EOU] men are fckin weird. [EOU] Leah [SAYS] AND he tried to walk me home, even though i told him straightforward that he was a creep. [EOU] Samantha [SAYS] girl, you're lucky that he didn’t kill you, what a psycho [EOU] i would totally freak out [EOU]

[EOU] Jen [SAYS] No. [EOU] He's freeloading and said he has no intention of giving back my money because I don't deserve it with the way I act. [EOU] Jane [SAYS] He has a nerve doesn't he? [EOU] How dare he?!!! [EOU] Jen [SAYS] I've learnt to hate him with a passion. [EOU] He's like vermin that you can't cull. [EOU] Abusive, nasty, annoying, irresponsible. [EOU] He disgusts me. [EOU] Jane [SAYS] Get rid of him! [EOU] I told you right from the beginning that he's no good. [EOU] Jen [SAYS] Yeah you were absolutely right.. [EOU] as always. [EOU] Jane [SAYS] I hate to say it but I can smell a fucktard a mile away. [EOU] Jen [SAYS] I seem to pick them, don't I? [EOU] Sometimes I think it is my fault. [EOU] If only I could be a better person, if only, if only.... [EOU] Jane [SAYS] You know that way of thinking will get you nowhere fast. [EOU] It's self defeating. [EOU] That's what the abusers want you think that you're bad and you deserve every bit of abuse that they dish out. [EOU] Jen [SAYS] What if he doesn't leave? [EOU] I'm afraid of asking him to leave 'cause it will only cause another fight. [EOU] Jane [SAYS] You can't spend your whole life walking on eggshells. [EOU] Jen [SAYS] Yeah, you're right... [EOU] but how do I get out of this mess? [EOU] Jane [SAYS] I think you've got to cut your losses and just move on. [EOU] Jen [SAYS] Easier said than done. [EOU] Jane [SAYS] I know. [EOU] You've gotta do it Hon. [EOU] If you don't things will only get worse. [EOU] Think of how much worse they've already got since you met him. [EOU] Jen [SAYS] Yeah you're right. [EOU] Sometimes I just don't have the strength. [EOU] Jane [SAYS] I believe in you. [EOU] Please do it! [EOU] Remember I'm always there for you. [EOU]

Andrew [SAYS] Hello Bez, this morning I wanted to take your car and go to Krizingen but it showed "low brake fluid level". [EOU] So I went only to the garage next to Willig and they said it's ok, probably a display error. [EOU] Do you want me to have the car checked properly? [EOU] Have you got a contract with some garage in particular? [EOU] Kate took your car today, just to check, and everything was fine. [EOU] It must have been in fact display error.

[EOU] ;> [EOU] Hannah [SAYS] A whole list ^^ [EOU] New year, new me :D [EOU] Brooklyn [SAYS] Really? [EOU] :D So how you're going to change your life this year? [EOU] Hannah [SAYS] First, I'm gonna lose weight and exercise everyday (or at least 3 times a week). [EOU] Second, I want to learn how to cook and start meal prepping [EOU] Finally, I'm gonna find my future husband (or at least start using dating apps):D [EOU] And you?

[EOU] Brooklyn [SAYS] I just don't believe that a new year means a fresh start. [EOU] Every past year I told myself I would lose weight, quit smoking, start going to the gym etc. [EOU] And I'm still a fatty, who smokes like a chimney and rarely leaves their couch. [EOU] Hannah [SAYS] You're a little ray of sunshine, aren't you? [EOU] ;) [EOU] Brooklyn [SAYS] :p And you're an undaunted optimist. [EOU] What makes you believe that everything is going to change for the better? [EOU] Hannah [SAYS] I don't know, I just like to think that we get numerous second chances to change our lives, to make right what's wrong. [EOU] That's it, I don't have any better explanation. [EOU] Brooklyn [SAYS] Well, you haven't convinced me. [EOU] :) Nevertheless good luck with all your resolutions. [EOU] ;) [EOU] Hannah [SAYS] Thanks! [EOU] :* [EOU]

[EOU] Trevor [SAYS] Well, it's her father's fault, Uncle. [EOU] Richard [SAYS] Her father's fault? [EOU] And him a church pastor? [EOU] Trevor [SAYS] Yes, Uncle. [EOU] She has sneaked me into the house really quietly and we are in her bedroom doing it. [EOU] Richard [SAYS] Fucking hell. [EOU] Do go on. [EOU] Trevor [SAYS] And we haven't got any condoms so I am planning to pull out at the last moment. [EOU] Richard [SAYS] Unbelieveable: Bloody idiot. [EOU] What then? [EOU] Trevor [SAYS] So I am just pulling out and all of a sudden in bursts her father and delivers me such a kick up the arse that I am back in there coming. [EOU] Richard [SAYS] So you say it is all his fault, then? [EOU] Incredible. [EOU] Trevor [SAYS] Yes. [EOU] Richard [SAYS] So maybe we can get him to pay the child support instead of you then, eh? [EOU]

[EOU] Julia [SAYS] Wasn't she on one already? [EOU] Gail [SAYS] Nah. [EOU] Whenever she posts a lot of fitness-related stuff, she's just thinking about, but doing nothing rly. [EOU] Julia [SAYS] I always thought she was training day and night! [EOU] Gail [SAYS] Nah. [EOU] That's just how she is. [EOU] The more she posts, the less she does. [EOU] Like she had a phase for animal shelters. [EOU] Remember? [EOU] Julia [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] She just wouldn't shut up about it. [EOU] She posted every single thing she could find on the subject! [EOU] Gail [SAYS] Right. [EOU] And turned out that was everything she did. [EOU] Never visited one. [EOU] Never donated a dime. [EOU] Never did anything.

[EOU] Julia [SAYS] I know :) that's y ppl like what I do, 'caus I genuine :) [EOU] Gail [SAYS] Yeah... [EOU] Julia [SAYS] What's that supposed to mean?

Hayden [SAYS] Anyway I have 1 month to write my thesis. [EOU] And then I need to decide what studies I should choose and I have a problem because I don't know what I can do in the future to make good money. [EOU] Margaret [SAYS] You'll find something. [EOU] Hayden [SAYS] And the only studies I'm interested in are African studies but I'm not sure I can make big money later on haha except for working in the embassy or something like that. [EOU] I was thinking about working as a flight attendant. [EOU] It would be easy for me to get that job since I can swim (and here it's obligatory) I'm even a water rescuer. [EOU] I know English italian and polish and a bit of german. [EOU] Margaret [SAYS] So go ahead for it. [EOU] Hayden [SAYS] But to be honest , I don't think so that job is so great. [EOU] I can't work there forever and I'm not that sure I wanna risk every time hahah since flight accidents happen. [EOU] Margaret [SAYS] Hahahaha you shouldn't think about that. [EOU] Hayden [SAYS] But I don't wanna die hhahahahah. [EOU] Margaret [SAYS] It would be good you would get to travel a lot [EOU]
Alan [SAYS] <file_photo> [EOU] look what I just found :) [EOU] Robert [SAYS] dude, that's just nasty and you know it :) [EOU] it has no sugar, no taste, and additional cinnamon flavoring.

[EOU] Alan [SAYS] well, and I found a perfect company for it <file_photo> [EOU] Robert [SAYS] oh, that's more like it! [EOU] but does the whiskey go well with the cinnamon? [EOU] flavored whiskey is the worst... [EOU] Alan [SAYS] Actually it does taste surprisingly well. [EOU] The cinnamon is not overpowering. [EOU] If you put enough whiskey that is :) [EOU] Rob [SAYS] Lol, thought so :) [EOU] I just wish the brought the old cherry flavor back... [EOU] not the useless no-sugar stuff. [EOU] Alan [SAYS] Ah, that is true :) [EOU]

[EOU] I was also thinking of working out a bit. [EOU] What do you do? [EOU] Do you go to a Gym? [EOU] Peter [SAYS] Yes, I hold a membership with the one near our office. [EOU] Lisa [SAYS] Which exercises do you do regularly? [EOU] Peter [SAYS] I do weights and run on the treadmill. [EOU] Lisa [SAYS] Besides exercises, I think I need to eat better to help me keep in shape. [EOU] Peter [SAYS] Another major requirement for good health is sleep. [EOU] On an average one requires at least 7-8 hours of sleep. [EOU] Lisa [SAYS] There are a lot of things we can do to stay healthy. [EOU] Peter [SAYS] Yes.

Don [SAYS] The CSS tests are today. [EOU] Hank [SAYS] I know! [EOU] Have you registered in their system? [EOU] Don [SAYS] No, not yet. [EOU] Hank [SAYS] I'm not sure if I have to fill out all the fields. [EOU] Most of them don't even apply to Rodney. [EOU] It's strange that they're incorporating such professional tests for little leaguers. [EOU] Don [SAYS] Hmm... [EOU] I don't know. [EOU] I'll check it later tonight when I get home. [EOU] Apparently it's supposed to be a database of all the young up-and-coming hockey stars. [EOU] Scouts use that information for future contracts, etc. [EOU] Hank [SAYS] OK, but our kids are 10 years old! [EOU] They're not signing any contracts for now :) [EOU] Don [SAYS] Well, obviously not, but it's kind of cool that they'll be in a world database of peewee hockey players. [EOU] Hank [SAYS] Yeah, I guess. [EOU] So apparently the tests are supposed to last 5-8 pm. [EOU] 3 hours! [EOU] I'll probably wait and work on the computer. [EOU] Don [SAYS] Bring a blanket :) It can get mighty cold sitting in a rink for 3 hours. [EOU] Hank [SAYS] No shit :) Are you coming. [EOU] Don [SAYS] Well, since you're going anyway, maybe you can take my kid :) [EOU] Hank [SAYS] Hey, that's not fair! [EOU] Don [SAYS] I'll take the kids next time, I promise! [EOU] Hank [SAYS] Yeah, yeah, we'll see. [EOU] I'll tell you about the tests when I bring Oscar and Roger back. [EOU] Don [SAYS] Ok, thanks again, I owe you. [EOU]

[EOU] Helen [SAYS] I have this wonderful perdiatrician, doctor Tornez, he is great with kids and treats every case individually. [EOU] Linda [SAYS] that's rare in these days - sometimes I think all doctors do is prescribe antibiotics :/ [EOU] Helen [SAYS] I know! [EOU] But doctor Torez i quite different. [EOU] You can find him at the City Medical Centre. [EOU] Linda [SAYS] The one next to the mall? [EOU] Helen [SAYS] exactly. [EOU] Linda [SAYS] Thanks!

Vincent [SAYS] <file_photo> [EOU] Damian [SAYS] What happened to your lamp? [EOU] Vincent [SAYS] I broke it xD [EOU] With my bare hand. [EOU] Damian [SAYS] You didn't do this just to show off did you? [EOU] Vincent [SAYS] Hahaha. [EOU] xD No. [EOU] I was playing with my cat with a ribbon [EOU] And while raising my hand I just hit the lamp and the glass cover broke. [EOU] Damian [SAYS] Shit happens. [EOU] You ordered new one yet? [EOU] Vincent [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] Should be ready to pick up on Tuesday xD [EOU]
Nestor [SAYS] I'm thinking of buying a new laptop [EOU] And it seems that now is a perfect time for it as Black Friday is coming. [EOU] Olaf [SAYS] Hahaha. [EOU] Nestor [SAYS] I haven't said anything funny, what's wrong with you. [EOU] Olaf [SAYS] Everything's fine with me, you're just being silly. [EOU] Nestor [SAYS] Why, cuz I want to save some money buying what I need when it's cheaper? [EOU] Do you actually know what Blak Friday is about? [EOU] Olaf [SAYS] Of course I know [EOU] It's a cunningly contrived sales pitch [EOU] Prices are thought to be reduced but in fact they're the same or even higher... [EOU] Nestor [SAYS] You're just repeating a stupid theory some people made up and try to convince others that it's based on facts. [EOU] Olaf [SAYS] You're really naive... [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] Click on this link and see for yourself [EOU] This is one of the sites where people upload photos of the same product and its price 2 weeks before Black Friday and during the promotion. [EOU] Nestor [SAYS] And how do I know whether it's a reliable source or not? [EOU] Olaf [SAYS] Carry out your own investigation [EOU] Go and check prices of the chosen products when the promotion is still on and check them again when the promotion is over [EOU] Simple. [EOU] Nestor [SAYS] What if the laptop I want has been really cheaper and I'll miss a perfect deal? [EOU] Olaf [SAYS] Then I'll help you [EOU] I know a dude who sells almost new computers at very reasonable prices. [EOU] Nestor [SAYS] So ask him to send the offer of what he has in stock to me first [EOU] If he can offer me a good deal, I'm going to the mall and starting investigation tomorrow [EOU] Deal? [EOU] Olaf [SAYS] Deal! [EOU] I'll call or text him and ask to contact you. [EOU] I'm sure he'll help you and you'll appreciate my advice :-) [EOU] Nestor [SAYS] We'll see about that [EOU]
Nancy [SAYS] Yeah, but u can also read the news online ;) [EOU] Phil [SAYS] I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. [EOU] Then u can choose what to read and what not. [EOU] Nancy [SAYS] Sounds sensible. [EOU] Does it have something 4 fashion? [EOU] Phil [SAYS] Probably so. [EOU] Not sure, though. [EOU] Nancy [SAYS] How about u, Vic? [EOU] Vic [SAYS] I still prefer Facebook. [EOU] Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook. [EOU] Phil [SAYS] Well, it's intended in a completely different way. [EOU] Vic [SAYS] What do u mean? [EOU] Phil [SAYS] IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. [EOU] U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u. [EOU] Vic [SAYS] Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. [EOU] And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters. [EOU] Phil [SAYS] 280. [EOU] Still, a downside. [EOU] OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook. [EOU] Nancy [SAYS] So no one uses 4 example Instagram? [EOU] Vic [SAYS] I do. [EOU] Phil [SAYS] Not 4 me. [EOU] I don't post that many pictures online. [EOU] Nancy [SAYS] But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. [EOU] There are also companies on Instagram. [EOU] Phil [SAYS] I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. [EOU] Vic [SAYS] That's not all ppl post on Instagram! [EOU] Phil [SAYS] So, what else? [EOU] Vic [SAYS] Depends on ur interest. [EOU] I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :) [EOU] Phil [SAYS] And does this motivate u to train? [EOU] Vic [SAYS] No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. [EOU] Nancy [SAYS] What do u think about Tumblr? [EOU] Phil [SAYS] What? [EOU] Vic [SAYS] Heard about it, but never had an account. [EOU] Nancy [SAYS] It's a microblogging website. [EOU] U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. [EOU] And ppl can observe u! [EOU] Phil [SAYS] Don't have that much time to write a blog. [EOU] Vic [SAYS] Me neither. [EOU] Phil [SAYS] Nancy, y do u ask these questions? [EOU] ;) [EOU] Nancy [SAYS] I have my reasons ;) [EOU]
Amanda [SAYS] have you seen the guy with dreads? [EOU] Peter [SAYS] yes, so awkward! [EOU] Dan [SAYS] hahaha, very, but cool! [EOU] Amanda [SAYS] I'm not convinced [EOU]

Dima [SAYS] hello! [EOU] Nada [SAYS] hey girl, what's up? [EOU] Dima [SAYS] I'm in a huge trouble, my laptop is broken and I have to deliver a translation tomorrow @9 😱😱 [EOU] Nada [SAYS] fuck what happened?? [EOU] Dima [SAYS] the stupid cat spilled coffee on it 😣😣 I'm freaking out! [EOU] you still have your old laptop? [EOU] is it possible to lend it to me please? [EOU] Nada [SAYS] no sorry, I've given it to my brother - but you're lucky! [EOU] I've taken these two days off so you can take mine. [EOU] Dima [SAYS] ooh man! [EOU] thank you sooo much!!! [EOU] if it weren't for Trados, I wouldn't be panicking :( [EOU] Nada [SAYS] no worries, it happened... [EOU] but I always think about this... [EOU] like man, we need some back up laptops! [EOU] Dima [SAYS] I know! [EOU] but I always change my mind and spend the money elsewhere lol. [EOU] Nada [SAYS] yeah, but it's like our only tool! [EOU] so we need to invest in it. [EOU] Dima [SAYS] yup, true ! [EOU] can I come in an hour to pick it up? [EOU] Nada [SAYS] yes :) ttyl! [EOU]

[EOU] Kelly [SAYS] not at all love, he is such an ass! [EOU]

Melody [SAYS] did you get your computer fixed yet? [EOU] Peggy [SAYS] no, im spending a lot of time using the library computers. [EOU] Melody [SAYS] do they know whats wrong with it? [EOU] Peggy [SAYS] might be something with the circuit board. [EOU] they hope to have an answer tomorrow. [EOU] Melody [SAYS] thats pretty serious. [EOU] might be cheaper just to buy a new one. [EOU] Peggy [SAYS] thats true. [EOU] well see. [EOU] Melody [SAYS] if you need to get a new one, i highly recommend the mac model that i have. [EOU] Peggy [SAYS] ok, good to know. [EOU] i'll write if i have any questions. [EOU] Melody [SAYS] youre probably due for a new one anyway, no? [EOU] Peggy [SAYS] you're right. [EOU] 5 years is a long time to own one. [EOU] Melody [SAYS] yes, thats ancient by laptop standards. [EOU] Peggy [SAYS] ok. [EOU] i might just not bother getting it repaired after all. [EOU] Melody [SAYS] sounds like a good idea [EOU]
Jerry [SAYS] Hi sweetie :) [EOU] Janet [SAYS] Hi sugar ;) [EOU] Jerry [SAYS] I'm coming home. [EOU] Janet [SAYS] Can't wait ;) [EOU] Jerry [SAYS] I should be there in 40 minutes.

Mark [SAYS] So, we've got our where and when. [EOU] Package tour or self-organised? [EOU] Anna [SAYS] Package. [EOU] More convenient. [EOU] George [SAYS] Self-organised. [EOU] Cheaper. [EOU] Julia [SAYS] Do we need a 5* hotel? [EOU] MAybe let's choose one of the cheaper options from a tour operator? [EOU] Mark [SAYS] Actually, not a bad idea. [EOU] That'll be both cheap and convenient. [EOU] Anna [SAYS] I'm in! [EOU] George [SAYS] So, let's start digging and we'll talk about it l8r? [EOU] Mark [SAYS] SLAP. [EOU] Julia [SAYS] Ok.

Stanley [SAYS] I can’t believe in her… [EOU] Bill [SAYS] What is it? [EOU] And who? [EOU] Stanley [SAYS] Del, she’s behaving kind of… stupid. [EOU] Bill [SAYS] Meaning? [EOU] Stanley [SAYS] I told her I can’t go for this weekend with her because of work. [EOU] Bill [SAYS] And? [EOU] How did she react? [EOU] Stanley [SAYS] She was angry and wouldn’t listen to me. [EOU] She accused me of having an affair o.O. [EOU] Bill [SAYS] You’ve been together for like 4 moths and she’s already doing sth like that??? [EOU] Stanley [SAYS] I know, it’s crazy. [EOU] I starting to give up. [EOU] Bill [SAYS] So what, that’s it? [EOU] Stanley [SAYS] No, I’ll talk to her when she’s back, I’ll tell her it can’t be like this, see what will she say. [EOU] Bill [SAYS] Sorry to say that, I don’t think you’ll bring any good news xD. [EOU] Stanley [SAYS] Actually, me too. [EOU] But at least I’ll try. [EOU] Bill [SAYS] Well, I’m sorry. [EOU] We need to take care of the Lidem project right now. [EOU] Stanley [SAYS] Yes I’m finishing the analysis for the pervious one, but it should be done tonight, so I can start working on it today. [EOU] Bill [SAYS] The problem is I don’t what you should do ;p. [EOU] Stanley [SAYS] whaaat. [EOU] Bill [SAYS] The analysis of tasks is not done yet, Alison disappeared from all the media and won’t answer her phone. [EOU] Stanley [SAYS] Great. [EOU] So division of the tasks is on me? [EOU] Bill [SAYS] Yes because I’m already researching when it comes to the funding. [EOU] Stanley [SAYS] We’ll do, it’ll be ready tomorrow, not sure what time. [EOU] Bill [SAYS] OK, keep me posted. [EOU] Stanley [SAYS] Btw, it’s weird that Alison is out of touch. [EOU] Bill [SAYS] No at all, it’s not the first time. [EOU] Stanley [SAYS] Women… [EOU]
Kimberly [SAYS] Hi Laura :) [EOU] Laura [SAYS] Hey Kim :) [EOU] Kimberly [SAYS] Do u remember if I left the cafe yesterday with my umbrella? [EOU] Laura [SAYS] I'm not sure... [EOU] I remember you arriving with it. [EOU] It was a pinkish-blue one, right? [EOU] Kimberly [SAYS] Yes, with a flower motive. [EOU] I got it as a present from my Mom a few years back. [EOU] It's not worth anything, but it's about the sentimental value. [EOU] Laura [SAYS] I understand, maybe try calling the cafe? [EOU] Maybe a customer found it or a waiter? [EOU] Here's the number: 613-785-4329. [EOU] Kimberly [SAYS] Thanks! [EOU] It's worth a try :)  [EOU]
Catherine [SAYS] Hi Jake, last week I applied for an accounting position @ Pandora. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] Hey Cathy! [EOU] Really? [EOU] That's great! [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] R u still working there? [EOU] Jake [SAYS] I sure am. [EOU] It's already been 5 yrs. [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] Time flies. [EOU] So I take it ur satisfied? [EOU] Jake [SAYS] I am, I rarely think about changing companies. [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] Does the company offer possibilities of personal development & promotion? [EOU] I mean is there a clear career path? [EOU] Jake [SAYS] Yup, that's the main pro of this place & the benefits. [EOU] I was promoted twice during these 5 yrs & the salary increase with each promotion is quite significant. [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] That's good to hear. [EOU] Most companies 2day are implementing cost saving policies & the employees are the ones who suffer. [EOU] I mean at my current workplace u can only count on inflation salary increases. [EOU] So u barely see the difference on ur paycheck. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] That's what I hear from most of my friends. [EOU] It's a tough time 4 employees on the market nowadays. [EOU] 4 now our company is still dynamically expanding. [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] And how about the benefits u mentioned? [EOU] Jake [SAYS] The company partially finances language & accounting courses. [EOU] There's also a yearly bonus that depends on your achievements and private healthcare. [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] That sounds like a dream :D Your HR dept. [EOU] gave me a call yesterday and invited me to an interview on Monday. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] That's great! [EOU] I'll keep my fingers crossed :) [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] Thanks Jake :) Is there anything I should prepare/review before the interview? [EOU] Jake [SAYS] Well I think it would be beneficial to know some facts about the company. [EOU] You can find them on the official website, in the "about us" section: <file_other> [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] OK, I'll definitely take a look. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] And they may ask u some Qs about accounting principles, the basics. [EOU] But I mean that won't be a problem 4 u. [EOU] I remember u graduated with honours from uni. [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] That's true. [EOU] :) I'm a bit nervous though. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] There's no need to be. [EOU] Give me a call after the interview. [EOU] Good luck! [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] Thanks. [EOU] TTYS! [EOU]

[EOU] Andrea [SAYS] No, no worries, it's no big deal. [EOU] Dan [SAYS] Thanks! [EOU] 💓 [EOU]

Matt [SAYS] I feel like my homestay parents don't treat me that well. [EOU] Jorge [SAYS] Why u think so? [EOU] Matt [SAYS] They take Carlos for subway [EOU] And I feel like they prefer talking to Carlos. [EOU] Jorge [SAYS] Do they feed you well tho. [EOU] Matt [SAYS] Yea I guess. [EOU] Jorge [SAYS] Maybe you're just overthinking. [EOU] Matt [SAYS] I don't know [EOU] It feels like a negative vibe [EOU] is it because I stay at home too much [EOU] And so They have to pay more for electricity. [EOU] Jorge [SAYS] I doubt it but hmm [EOU] I would give a fuck [EOU] You're there one more month and go. [EOU] Matt [SAYS] True [EOU]

[EOU] Whitney [SAYS] Sounds delicious, I am mouth watering! [EOU]

[EOU] Trent [SAYS] yeah, we do that like you said and it works. [EOU] Joel [SAYS] and if she wakes you in the morning you can just lock her out of the room until feeding time. [EOU] Becky [SAYS] she hasn't done that yet actually. [EOU] Joel [SAYS] I'm pretty sure it's coming :P. [EOU] Trent [SAYS] so far she's been really sweet. [EOU] Joel [SAYS] I'm glad.

Clint [SAYS] I'm curious. [EOU] How's the waste management working out over there? [EOU] Ronnie [SAYS] It actually works very well. [EOU] We use three different bins: compost, recycle and trash. [EOU] Compost anything organic from yard waste to food scraps. [EOU] Recycle for paper, bottles, cardboard, plastic, metals. [EOU] And trash everything else. [EOU] Why do you ask? [EOU] Clint [SAYS] Sheer curiosity. [EOU] What about general awareness? [EOU] Plastic bags, etc.? [EOU] Ronnie [SAYS] Very high. [EOU] No more single use plastic bags in grocery stores. [EOU] No more straws in restaurants. [EOU] Clint [SAYS] Yeah, I read yours was one of the cities that banned them. [EOU] I wonder when that will get here. [EOU] Ronnie [SAYS] Never... [EOU] Clint: [SAYS] What do you mean? [EOU] Ronnie [SAYS] I highly doubt that type of environmental awareness will happen there. [EOU] People there live in a different world when it comes to that. [EOU] Clint [SAYS] People don't have to have any awareness, tbh. [EOU] It's above them. [EOU] If there were such decisions made they would follow. [EOU] Ronnie [SAYS] That is true. [EOU] But at the state government level I don't think there is that awareness either. [EOU] But hopefully I am proven wrong! [EOU] Clint [SAYS] Really bizarre. [EOU] I noticed it's struggling here. [EOU] On the other hand, it's money. [EOU] Ronnie [SAYS] Money in the sense of? [EOU] Clint [SAYS] Reducing waste=lower utilization costs. [EOU] Do they sort through everything further down? [EOU] Ronnie [SAYS] Yes here they do. [EOU] Clint [SAYS] It seems to be the same way here. [EOU] Dry recyclables, food and general, compost  [EOU]

Noah [SAYS] Hi there! [EOU] The quince we talked about the other day... [EOU] Are you still interested? [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you. [EOU] Noah [SAYS] Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. [EOU] They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time. [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] That's very very kind of him! [EOU] He's really a darling. [EOU] We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. [EOU] How long will they keep? [EOU] Is it windfall? [EOU] Noah [SAYS] Both really but they all look very healthy. [EOU] No bruises afa one can see. [EOU] Or only odd small ones. [EOU] They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. [EOU] The weather's cool. [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] It would be a shame if they rotted. [EOU] I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap. [EOU] Noah [SAYS] OK. [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. [EOU] Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince? [EOU] Noah [SAYS] Absolutely! [EOU] In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. [EOU] Of course it would be great to see your twins again. [EOU] Haven't seen them for ages! [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony. [EOU] Noah [SAYS] Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much. [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] I don't blame them! [EOU] We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. [EOU] Everything's absolutely fine. [EOU] You don't have William at home all that often either, do you? [EOU] Noah [SAYS] He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of "family care" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. [EOU] They have a strict regime at the academy. [EOU] But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. [EOU] What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own. [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] The fate of most military I guess. [EOU] Hugely unfair I'd say. [EOU] Like being married to your regiment! [EOU] Noah [SAYS] That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! [EOU] I never hear a girl's name! [EOU] And when I ask, he gets brusque. [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] Oh dear! [EOU] What could it mean? [EOU] Noah [SAYS] No, not what you think! [EOU] We know from Capt. [EOU] Broomsberg about their common escapades. [EOU] Plenty of women but only that sort of women. [EOU] No strings. [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] I never even imagined he might be gay! [EOU] Surely not. [EOU] But there must be sth else. [EOU] Noah [SAYS] We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. [EOU] Nothing else counts for him. [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] He's always been very strong-willed. [EOU] And he knows what he wants. [EOU] Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all. [EOU] Noah [SAYS] You're probably right. [EOU] But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me. [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] They'll come, don't you worry! [EOU] Look the twins will contact you about the quince. [EOU] Alright? [EOU] Noah [SAYS] Sure. [EOU] Thank you Sophie for a nice chat! [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] Thank you for the quince! [EOU]

[EOU] Rory [SAYS] does she speak Chinese? [EOU] Max [SAYS] I think she does already. [EOU] Joseph [SAYS] Hard to control I imagine. [EOU] Max [SAYS] hahaha. [EOU] Eliza [SAYS] I think this is the best investment imaginable. [EOU] Max [SAYS] really? [EOU] Eliza [SAYS] sure, the every 5th earthling is Chinese [EOU] or so.

[EOU] Ben [SAYS] you know very well that I'm not fond of such visits [EOU] they stress me out. [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] Come on, even you can do it from time to time. [EOU] Ben [SAYS] maybe I can but I don't want to [EOU] it will end the same way as usual [EOU] with me being pissed at everyone. [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] The boys want to see you. [EOU] Ben [SAYS] I can visit you and play with them some other day [EOU] I don't have to drive to another city to do it. [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] You know that he'll be disappointed? [EOU] Ben [SAYS] uncle Steve? [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] Yes. [EOU] Ben [SAYS] I don't think so, we don't have anything in common [EOU] all he ever does is bothering me with stupid questions about my private life. [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] Maybe that's his way of showing that he cares about you. [EOU] Ben [SAYS] yes... [EOU] sure... [EOU] sometimes I wonder if you're thinking about what you type :P. [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] Depends on the day [EOU] Today I'm tired so I can't guarantee it. [EOU] Ben [SAYS] you should rest then [EOU] instead of asking me to do stuff I don't like. [EOU] Catherine [SAYS] Alright, don't worry, I'll stop [EOU] But still the part about the boys missing you was true [EOU] So come and visit them when you'll have the chance.

Henry [SAYS] Do you know what happened to cafe Kohaku? [EOU] Julia [SAYS] The one near Covent Garden? [EOU] Henry [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] I wanted to reserve a table, but I can't find them anywhere. [EOU] Their Facebook page disappeared. [EOU] Julia [SAYS] I'm afraid they're closed :( [EOU] Henry [SAYS] For good?! [EOU] Julia [SAYS] Afraid so. [EOU] I've been there last week and wanted to take my cousin there, but the place's empty [EOU] Probably the rent was too high. [EOU] Henry [SAYS] Oh no, I loved that place. [EOU] Julia [SAYS] Me too. [EOU] I checked online for the owners and contacted them, but they haven't replied yet. [EOU] I hope they will reopen somewhere else. [EOU] Henry [SAYS] Unless they do it far away, the location was perfect. [EOU] It was a real gem in this touristy district. [EOU] Julia [SAYS] I know, I know... [EOU] We went the Lilly's in the end, my cousin and I, but it's not the same. [EOU] Henry [SAYS] Eh, that's a pity then, I was so looking forward to their brownie [EOU] How was the Lilly's? [EOU] Julia [SAYS] It's all right, it's a different vibe though. [EOU] I think you should go to the Japan Centre for the same. [EOU] Henry [SAYS] Uhm, don't think so. [EOU] It's always awfully crowded and there are more tourists than normal people like us [EOU]
Jake [SAYS] What are your plans for the day? [EOU] Olivia [SAYS] I haven't really got anything planned. [EOU] There are some things I should do which I haven't looked at for a while. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] Like what? [EOU] Olivia [SAYS] I ought to do my accounts. [EOU] At least get all the incoming and outgoing invoices sorted by months. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] Tax filing is a long way off. [EOU] Olivia [SAYS] I know, but doing it all at the last minute is a dreadful headache. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] Anything else? [EOU] Olivia [SAYS] I also have a few videos I need to upload to YouTube. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] Already ready or you still need to do post-production? [EOU] Olivia [SAYS] I don't really do much by way of post-production. [EOU] I'm not exactly Steven Spielberg. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] I do, but I dont always have time to do much. [EOU] Olivia [SAYS] If I put in any music I always get a copyright strike and someone else is taking the ad revenue. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] And some of those claims are purely speculative. [EOU] One time I put on one of my own pieces and it was challenged by Sony Music. [EOU] Olivia [SAYS] No way! [EOU] Jake [SAYS] It's true. [EOU] On the form you fill in to counter the claim I said if Sony want to make me one of their signed artists, that's fine. [EOU] Otherwise to get they paws off of my music. [EOU]
Emily [SAYS] Oh Linda...Something horrible has happened. [EOU] I'm so sorry. [EOU] I have broken one of your green tea cups. [EOU] Just looked away and brushed it off the table with my skirt. [EOU] SORRY! [EOU] Linda [SAYS] No worries babe! [EOU] It's nothing. [EOU] Really. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] I'm feeling so bad about it. [EOU] So clumsy of me. [EOU] Linda [SAYS] Look. [EOU] I never really liked the set, so one cup makes no difference. [EOU] I hardly use it anyway. [EOU] How come it was on the table BTW? [EOU] Emily [SAYS] I was cleaning the cupboards in the dining room. [EOU] Linda [SAYS] You did what? [EOU] Whatever for? [EOU] The crockery there is more for decoration. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] Exactly. [EOU] I thought they're so pretty, especially the green ones, and then noticed how dusty they are. [EOU] So I thought I'd be a helpful guest and wash them. [EOU] I did. [EOU] And then I made myself a cuppa in the green one. [EOU] And it happened. [EOU] Linda [SAYS] Ya golden! [EOU] Really! [EOU] Look, calm down. [EOU] You are a fantastic guest. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] Ya. [EOU] Smashing. [EOU] As we say in GB. [EOU] Linda [SAYS] You know what? [EOU] Take out the whole green set. [EOU] If you like it so much - it is yours. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] But Linda! [EOU] I'm speechless. [EOU] Linda [SAYS] Precious! [EOU] See you in the evening! [EOU] Emily [SAYS] CU [EOU] And THANK YOU [EOU]

Stella [SAYS] Hi Sandra [EOU] Did you recover finally? [EOU] I wanted to come and visit you but I didn't want to get infected by the disease that you've been carrying [EOU] You know... [EOU] I'm a teacher, I could spread the disease. [EOU] Sandra [SAYS] Hello my dear [EOU] I'm getting better every day but there's still something left [EOU] I have some effective medicines now [EOU] All the drugs that doctors have been prescribing to me so far were useless [EOU] Now the difference in my well-being is surprisingly considerable. [EOU] Stella [SAYS] It's very nice to here that, I'm so happy for you! [EOU] Hope you'll be in a perfect health soon [EOU] I want to take you to the cinema [EOU] They have a brilliant repertoire now. [EOU] Sandra [SAYS] Oh, I dream of getting out of the house! [EOU] I used to love laying in the bed for hours, but now I hate it. [EOU] Stella [SAYS] I understand [EOU] Just tell me, what kind of movie would you like to watch? [EOU] A romantic comedy, horror, fantasy or something else? [EOU] I'll do some research in my friends' midst and try to choose the best option :) [EOU] Sandra [SAYS] I'm dreaming of watching some action movie [EOU] With all the special effects and dynamic action [EOU] Something that would be the opposite of my current situation :) [EOU] Stella [SAYS] You got it! [EOU] :) [EOU] I'll find something special for you [EOU] So I'm keeping my fingers crossed for your quick recovery [EOU] Talk to you soon! [EOU] :) [EOU] Sandra [SAYS] Thanks, Stella, my darling. [EOU] You made my day :) [EOU] Bye bye [EOU]

[EOU] You remember that we have plans for tomorrow...? [EOU] James [SAYS] both [EOU] yes, I do. [EOU] Mia [SAYS] ok. [EOU] James [SAYS] Are you mad at me? [EOU] Babe, the fact that I suggested that we might go out with Amelia doesn't mean that I don't value time that we spend together, just the two of us. [EOU] Mia [SAYS] I know, I said ok. [EOU] James [SAYS] Are you sure you're fine with this? [EOU] Mia [SAYS] Yup. [EOU] :) [EOU] I just don't know her very well, it's gonna be stressful for me. [EOU] James [SAYS] :) But you know me, don't you? [EOU] Mia [SAYS] Maybe I do :D [EOU] James [SAYS] Really, there's nothing to worry about. [EOU] Amelia is quite laid-back and likable.

Mariana [SAYS] Hi, just a quick question. [EOU] Do you know if the readings for the next session of Stephen’s seminar are in the print shop? [EOU] Rita [SAYS] No idea, sorry. [EOU] Chae-yeong [SAYS] The only thing I know is that they were not yet there on Monday. [EOU] Arthur [SAYS] Yer, I’ve made the mistake of going on Monday as well and I can confirm the texts were not there and the staff was as rude as always. [EOU] Mariana [SAYS] Sounds familiar. [EOU] Rita [SAYS] I’ll go tomorrow morning and let you know if the texts are available [EOU] I can’t buy the copies for you because they never have enough at hand but I’ll just ask them to print more for later. [EOU] Chae-yeong [SAYS] No worries. [EOU] Arthur [SAYS] Yeah, just let us know if they’re ready, that’s a huge favour already. [EOU] Rita [SAYS] Cool. [EOU] Will do! [EOU] xx [EOU]
Ost [SAYS] I bought a garage place in the garage. [EOU] Vesna [SAYS] Cool. [EOU] Ost [SAYS] I got it cheap. [EOU] It's my intention to rent it out and do the restitution of my money. [EOU] Vesna [SAYS] Well doneeeee!. [EOU] Ost [SAYS] There is a big crowd in parking, so the prices for finding garage places are favorable, in this area. [EOU] Vesna [SAYS] Really!. [EOU] Ost [SAYS] Return on investment is much higher than if I give money under term savings in the Bank. [EOU] Vesna [SAYS] You make sense for money. [EOU] Ost [SAYS] The interest rates are very small, almost close to zero, "only they do not ask you to pay them, for holding money in the Bank". [EOU] Vesna [SAYS] O yes. [EOU] Ost [SAYS] Prices of garage places, in Belgrade, will only grow. [EOU] Vesna [SAYS] Really!. [EOU] Ost [SAYS] Yes, there are more and more vehicles in the city center, as the number of vehicles per family is growing. [EOU] It used to be about one vehicle per family, and now it's approaching an average of two vehicles. [EOU] Vesna [SAYS] Yes.. [EOU] Ost [SAYS] And there will not be new parking space. [EOU]
Julia [SAYS] Where are you? [EOU] Hania [SAYS] That's a good question, haha. [EOU] Julia [SAYS] Did you stop in Zawiercie already? [EOU] Hania [SAYS] No idea... [EOU] the schedule says the next station is in Poraj. [EOU] Julia [SAYS] Gosh, that's really far away. [EOU] Hania [SAYS] Don't even tell me, I have been on the road for 3 hours already. [EOU] Julia [SAYS] I know how you feel love, I am sick of trains already :( [EOU] Hania [SAYS] I will be there around 7pm I guess :( [EOU] Julia [SAYS] I will be waiting! [EOU] :* [EOU] Hania [SAYS] Great! [EOU] Julia [SAYS] You must be starving, I am gonna make some food. [EOU] What would you like? [EOU] Hania [SAYS] Nah, I am so exhausted I don't even feel any hunger. [EOU] Julia [SAYS] Are you sure?? [EOU] Hania [SAYS] Or actually maybe we will order some takeaway? [EOU] Julia [SAYS] Sounds like a plan :) pizza or burgers? [EOU] Hania [SAYS] Pizza always :D [EOU] Julia [SAYS] OK! [EOU] And I will pick you up from the platform, let me know when you pass Żyrardów. [EOU] Hania [SAYS] Ok, see you soon! [EOU] :* [EOU] Julia [SAYS] See you :)) [EOU]

[EOU] Mazie [SAYS] You just saw her on a bad day. [EOU] Lee [SAYS] Don't think so! [EOU] Mazie [SAYS] You did spill a drink on her. [EOU] Lee [SAYS] Well... [EOU] Mazie [SAYS] You did!

[EOU] Albert [SAYS] Were both interviews for jobs at hotels? [EOU] Joseph [SAYS] Yeah, I guess I'm gonna be a concierge until the day I die. [EOU] Albert [SAYS] O la la! [EOU] A concierge! [EOU] With his résumé! [EOU] Joseph [SAYS] What's so funny about it? [EOU] Albert [SAYS] It reminded me of that Simpsons episode, you know... [EOU] "the GARAGE?! [EOU] o la dee dah, Mr. [EOU] Frenchman!" [EOU] Joseph [SAYS] Right! [EOU] "Well, how do you call it?" [EOU] Albert [SAYS] "A carhole!" XD. [EOU] Joseph [SAYS] Lol! [EOU] Anyway the third interview was ok but I don't know, the woman there didn't seem to like me. [EOU] Albert [SAYS] NO WOMAN likes you, Joe! [EOU] Joseph [SAYS] Oh, sod off, mate! [EOU]

Brett [SAYS] So what do u do there? [EOU] Drive a tank all the time? [EOU] John [SAYS] Yes and no. [EOU] U've got players from around the world and they have their tank squadrons and u battle them. [EOU] Can be a lot of fun! [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] So what happens if someone is on a higher level than u? [EOU] They basically destroy u! [EOU] John [SAYS] That's not a problem. [EOU] The game doesn't allow higher ranked players o interact with players out of their range. [EOU] Brett [SAYS] What do u mean? [EOU] John [SAYS] If ur on lvl 5, a player on lvl 30 can't attack u. [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] Sensible. [EOU] Unlike WoW. [EOU] John [SAYS] So what's WoW like? [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] Imagine having a character u rly like and u give it a lot of ur attention and get experience point, level up and so on. [EOU] Someone who's played the game for like a year comes and kills u instantly. [EOU] Brett [SAYS] Not cool. [EOU] John [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] Y would they allow such a thing? [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] Well, open world, u can team up with anyone, do quests together, arrange fighting tactics and so on. [EOU] Brett [SAYS] Actually, my cousin met his wife there :) [EOU] John [SAYS] Rly? [EOU] Brett [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] They were playing together for some time, talking and at some point he invited her to a date. [EOU] Turned out they lived very close to each other ;) [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] That's gr8! [EOU] And how are they getting along now? [EOU] Brett [SAYS] Most fights are about who gets 2 play at a given moment ;) [EOU] John [SAYS] Lol. [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] Well my favourite genre is RPGs :) [EOU] John [SAYS] Can u name a title, except WoW? [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] I can name a dozen, but one of my personal faves is the Final Fantasy series :) [EOU] Brett [SAYS] What's this one about? [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] Don't tell me u haven't heard about the greatest RPG series of all times? [EOU] John [SAYS] Well, I haven't. [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] I think I'll have to look for new friends... [EOU] So embarrassing. [EOU] Brett [SAYS] C'mon! [EOU] Tell us! [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] Fine... [EOU] Usually u play a group of friends that have to resolve some kind of crisis. [EOU] In the last part u play a prince whose kingdom has been destroyed and u try to well get revenge. [EOU] Brett [SAYS] Sounds boring. [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] Believe me, it's not! [EOU]
Rael [SAYS] Gosh, I fucking hate my job! [EOU] Zach [SAYS] Oops! [EOU] Someone is in a mood... [EOU] Rael [SAYS] I'm serious, I'm done. [EOU] Those people are fucked up. [EOU] I cannot stand it anymore. [EOU] Zach [SAYS] Is it that bad? [EOU] Rael [SAYS] Even worse... [EOU] Zach [SAYS] What this time? [EOU] Rael [SAYS] I don't even have time to eat my fucking lunch. [EOU] It's not normal. [EOU] Zach [SAYS] Did you talk to your manager? [EOU] Rael [SAYS] Yeah, this retard doesn't get that we're humans not robots. [EOU] I hate him. [EOU] Zach [SAYS] You're gonna quit? [EOU] Rael [SAYS] It's not that easy, I gotta find something. [EOU] I don't want to leave without first finding a new job. [EOU] Zach [SAYS] I see. [EOU] Did you think about IT? [EOU] Rael [SAYS] No, why? [EOU] Zach [SAYS] Girl, it's the best place to work in! [EOU] A lot of my friends started as software testers and they are really satisfied. [EOU] Good money and no rat race. [EOU] Rael [SAYS] Zach, are you crazy? [EOU] I don't have technical studies. [EOU] Zach [SAYS] You don't have to. [EOU] If you have good analytical skills all you need is some online course - Udemy or something. [EOU] People change their career after years of employment in totally different business. [EOU] It's not that difficult, really. [EOU] You should give it a try. [EOU] Tech is our future. [EOU] Rael [SAYS] Hmm... [EOU] Maybe you're right. [EOU] I'm still not sure what to do with my career, so... [EOU] why not. [EOU] Zach [SAYS] If you want, I can talk to my friends and they will give you some advice on how to start, what courses to choose and so on. [EOU] Rael [SAYS] That would be great, thanks. [EOU] Zach [SAYS] UW. [EOU] In touch. [EOU]

Kate [SAYS] I just had a fight with Chris :/ [EOU] Mary [SAYS] Oh no, not again. [EOU] Kate [SAYS] It's not me who started it. [EOU] I don't know why he says certain stuff, it seems like he's doing it on purpose. [EOU] Mary [SAYS] What was it this time? [EOU] Kate [SAYS] Same thing, as always. [EOU] Really, he knows what I think and I know what he thinks so I don't bring up certain things. [EOU] I don't want to argue, but if it keeps happening, I don't see the point of talking to him [EOU] I'm angry every single time I talk with him. [EOU] Mary [SAYS] Eh, I don't get why he keeps doing it. [EOU] What did he say? [EOU] Kate [SAYS] I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. [EOU] He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it. [EOU] Mary [SAYS] oh god. [EOU] Kate [SAYS] right?! [EOU] I don't know why I'm still talking with him. [EOU] I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck. [EOU] Mary [SAYS] What did you tell him? [EOU] Kate [SAYS] What I usually tell him. [EOU] He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, I sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything. [EOU] Mary [SAYS] I'm afraid Chris may be too pig-headed for that. [EOU] Kate [SAYS] Pfff I bet he didn't even read anything. [EOU] He's just watching the nationalists, Trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once. [EOU] Mary [SAYS] I know, to be honest I kind of avoid these subjects when I'm talking with him. [EOU] Kate [SAYS] Well, I try to as well, but as you can see he can't stop himself [EOU] I know he's our friend and we go out often, but I'm not sure I can do it any more, I don't want be friends with someone who thinks that Mexican children are worse and that they should be kept away from the US. [EOU] Mary [SAYS] Oh my god he said that? [EOU] Kate [SAYS] Yes :/ [EOU] Mary [SAYS] Jesus, I knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? [EOU] That's a bit too much. [EOU] Kate [SAYS] You're telling me this. [EOU] I think we should reconsider this let's say friendship, because if every conversation will lead to something like this, I'm not interested in staying in touch with him. [EOU] Mary [SAYS] No wonder [EOU]
Celine [SAYS] <file_picture> [EOU] Mia [SAYS] where are you? [EOU] Celine [SAYS] We went on skates. [EOU] Mia [SAYS] Mark knows how to skate? [EOU] Celine [SAYS] No. [EOU] It's his first time. [EOU] Thanks to that, we have a lot of fun here. [EOU] Mia [SAYS] I would like to be there with you [EOU]

[EOU] Lia [SAYS] How much did you pay? [EOU] Sarah [SAYS] 500 quid. [EOU] Lia [SAYS] It's expensive. [EOU] Sarah [SAYS] What to do... [EOU] Lia [SAYS] I'll see maybe my family can help me out. [EOU] It would be lovely to spend holidays with them. [EOU] Sarah [SAYS] This year we are going to the desert. [EOU] The whole family will sleep in a huge tent. [EOU] Lia [SAYS] That's great. [EOU] Last year we went to Negev. [EOU] Sarah [SAYS] Really? [EOU] That's where we are going this year. [EOU] Lia [SAYS] It is absolutely amazing. [EOU] You will love it!

Will [SAYS] I hate ques. [EOU] I'm standing in a line longer than the post office itself. [EOU] In order to just send a damn letter in XXI century. [EOU] Damn. [EOU] Chris [SAYS] What a time to be alive :D [EOU] Lines are the part of everday life of any person living in a big city. [EOU] There is nothing special in it, but I hope you'll think twice next time you decide to send a traditional letter. [EOU] Will [SAYS] The best think about my XXI century comment is that the line consists almost entirely of elderly people who don't have bank account and pay their bills via post office paying cash. [EOU] Where is digitalisation when you need it? [EOU] Chris [SAYS] Haha. [EOU] Hang on there. [EOU]  [EOU]
Tobi [SAYS] Have you been to the new club? [EOU] Nicholas [SAYS] Cork? [EOU] Tobi [SAYS] yes, this one. [EOU] Serena [SAYS] waste of time. [EOU] Ella [SAYS] yes, huge disappointment. [EOU] Serena [SAYS] we went there with Ella last weekend. [EOU] Ella [SAYS] because they had such a cool ad campaign. [EOU] Serena [SAYS] you won't believe. [EOU] Ella [SAYS] it was empty [EOU] nobody there. [EOU] Tobi [SAYS] oh, shit. [EOU] Ella [SAYS] yes, that's the proper word. [EOU] Nicholas [SAYS] they need some time maybe? [EOU] Ella [SAYS] maybe, but I won't risk again [EOU]
Molly [SAYS] guys, do you think it's a very bad idea to go to Sweden for a week in January? [EOU] Margaret [SAYS] we bought some cheap tickets half a year ago and now we're hesitating. [EOU] Peter [SAYS] haha, no but it will be just dark and cold. [EOU] Margaret [SAYS] rainy? [EOU] Kai [SAYS] possibly [EOU] but if you stay in Stockholm there are always nice things to do [EOU] museums, bars etc [EOU] not so much nature though [EOU] which is truly stunning around Stockholm. [EOU] Margaret [SAYS] yes, but it's January, one would have to go to Argentina to enjoy nature. [EOU] Kai [SAYS] exactly. [EOU] Peter [SAYS] visit the Vasa Museum, it's really fun. [EOU] Molly [SAYS] we will:) thanks ;) [EOU] Peter [SAYS] enjoy! [EOU]

[EOU] Mair [SAYS] Yeah, I remember that. [EOU] Glad to be out of it and the bitching and bullying, of course! [EOU] Mel [SAYS] Yes, you had a nasty little bunch on your section.

Pam [SAYS] Hey I lost my phone so if you need something message me here. [EOU] Dot [SAYS] Oh now how?? [EOU] Pam [SAYS] I went shopping and when I was paying I must have left my phone on the counter. [EOU] Dot [SAYS] Did you come back to check if they found it? [EOU] Pam [SAYS] I talked to every single store I visited and nothing :( [EOU] Dot [SAYS] It was an iphone right? [EOU] Pam [SAYS] Yeah, I've only had it for half a year. [EOU] Dot [SAYS] But there's an option where you can display something on the screen. [EOU] Pam [SAYS] How? [EOU] Dot [SAYS] You have to log into your apple account and there is an instruction. [EOU] Pam [SAYS] Cool!! [EOU] I have to check it out. [EOU] Dot [SAYS] You could promise a reward and post someone's phone number. [EOU] Pam [SAYS] I'll do that!! [EOU] Thanks!! [EOU] Dot [SAYS] I hope you find it :* [EOU]
Rodney [SAYS] Have you heard a guy got beaten and mugged on campus? [EOU] Truman [SAYS] Oh, man is he ok? [EOU] Ross [SAYS] Do they have any idea who did it? [EOU] Rodney [SAYS] They're gonna give an official statement about. [EOU] There's also gonna be an article in the paper. [EOU] As far as I know the assailant had a mask on. [EOU] Truman [SAYS] And what about the beaten guy? [EOU] Rodney [SAYS] He's in the hospital, but it seems like he'll be fine. [EOU] Ross [SAYS] You think it was a student? [EOU] Rodney [SAYS] Who knows what those jocks are capable of. [EOU] Ross [SAYS] They could do it just for fun. [EOU] Truman [SAYS] On the other hand its easy to get on campus without being detected. [EOU] Ross [SAYS] There are cameras. [EOU] Truman [SAYS] If your masked it don't matter. [EOU] You know how those security guards are. [EOU] Rodney [SAYS] They don't give a fuck. [EOU] Ross [SAYS] True that. [EOU] Truman [SAYS] Hope they catch the guy soon [EOU]
Nathan [SAYS] Hey Honey, what are our plans for tomorrow then? [EOU] Deborah [SAYS] So I've been thinking that we should pack everything today, we won't have time tomorrow. [EOU] Nathan [SAYS] Totally true, I started packing my stuff in the bedroom, I also told the girls to start packing too. [EOU] Deborah [SAYS] If Sofie wants to take the unicorn we won't have much space in the car XD. [EOU] Nathan [SAYS] No, I explained to her that he'll be fine without her these few days, I hope it worked :D [EOU] Deborah [SAYS] We need to take boots and those warm jackets for the girls, my parents promised them to take them on a trip to the forest. [EOU] Nathan [SAYS] I remember, Lucy was really excited about that. [EOU] Are we taking the bicycles? [EOU] Deborah [SAYS] Yeah, don't you think we could use some alone time while the rest of the family is hiking? [EOU] XD. [EOU] Nathan [SAYS] Now you're talking! [EOU] We could have a ride to this beautiful cliff where we were last year! [EOU] Deborah [SAYS] Why not, it's a wonderful idea! [EOU] :* [EOU] Nathan [SAYS] So tomorrow I'm seeing the dentist after work, you go to pick up the girls from school… [EOU] Deborah [SAYS] Yeah, then we meet at home, have a quick bite (you probably won't, haha!) [EOU] Nathan [SAYS] Thanks Honey, so nice of you to remind me of this! [EOU] After the quick bite you girls have, we are off! [EOU] Deborah [SAYS] Damn, I forgot to buy this syrup for travel sickness. [EOU] Will you have time today to do it? [EOU] Nathan [SAYS] Yes, it's feasible :) I'll do it on my way from work. [EOU] Deborah [SAYS] Wonderful! [EOU] So see you in the evening then? [EOU] Nathan [SAYS] I should be home around 6, if nothing happens. [EOU] Deborah [SAYS] Dinner will be waiting for you in the oven, bye :* [EOU]
Casper [SAYS] Is any of you nobel fellows going for tomorrow's classes with Mr Linda? [EOU] Alexander [SAYS] Hmm... [EOU] To be or not to be, that is the question! [EOU] But remembering the last lecture with Linda, my answer is like moving towards NO. [EOU] Igor [SAYS] Amen to that, Alex! [EOU] Last time I came so self-motivated and full of energy that I thought I could even dominate the lecture [EOU] I sat in the second row, concentrated, even took some notes and asked two questions [EOU] After few minutes Lewis poked me and told to stop snoring... [EOU] Casper [SAYS] Ahahahaha [EOU] True, I saw that! [EOU] Alexander [SAYS] I think it's not that the subjects themselves are boring, it must be his voice [EOU] I mean it's so monotonous and hypnotic. [EOU] Kind of... [EOU] lulling you to sleep. [EOU] Igor [SAYS] Yeah, that guy is like David Copperfield among lecturers. [EOU] Alexander [SAYS] Haha David Copperfield :D [EOU] Let's call him like that from now on! [EOU] He even looks like the magician a little :D [EOU] Casper [SAYS] That's a fancy nickname, I like it [EOU] But if I wanted to see a magician, I'd rather go to the circus. [EOU] Igor [SAYS] So... [EOU] Judging from the overall tone of our discussion I feel that the decision's been already made [EOU] Am I right, gentlemen? [EOU] Casper [SAYS] Actually your opinions, my noble fellows, have conirmed my conviction that going there and wasting time doesn't make sense. [EOU] Alexander [SAYS] Not a bit! [EOU] And learning from Igor's last experience I think we should go somewhere else instead [EOU] I don't want to end up snoring and getting embarrassed :D [EOU] Casper [SAYS] Great, so we've reached an unanimous decision. [EOU] Igor [SAYS] So where are we going instead? [EOU] Casper [SAYS] Let's meet near the university and we'll work something out. [EOU] Igor [SAYS] Agreed. [EOU] Alexander [SAYS] All right! [EOU]
Javier [SAYS] Hey do you know any tattoo parlors over here with English speaking employees? [EOU] Judie [SAYS] Oh there's Warsaw ink. [EOU] Javier [SAYS] the name sounds neat...

[EOU] Judie [SAYS] <file_photo> [EOU] Javier [SAYS] wow that looks amazing [EOU] how much did she pay? [EOU] Judie [SAYS] it was a 1000 [EOU] Javier [SAYS] fuck [EOU] let me just get a tatttoo back in colombia then, thx [EOU]

Marsha [SAYS] Guys, we've planned the trip with John last night as we promised. [EOU] Cynthia [SAYS] great, thank you for that. [EOU] Marsha [SAYS] but of course you have to agree on that. [EOU] Mohammad [SAYS] sure, but I really trust you. [EOU] Gavin [SAYS] me too. [EOU] Marsha [SAYS] so as we decided last time, we will spend a week just on the beach [EOU] we all wanted some calm, nice place, right? [EOU] Gavin [SAYS] yes!!! [EOU] Marsha [SAYS] John found this little hotel in Nosy Be [EOU] <file_photo> [EOU] and their website: <file_other> [EOU] it's quite basic the website, but it may actually be a good sign. [EOU] Gavin [SAYS] I love it! [EOU] Cynthia [SAYS] it seems just perfect. [EOU] Marsha [SAYS] I know [EOU] it's more expensive than hotels on the mainland [EOU] but it seems to be the most beautiful place in Madagascar. [EOU] Mohammad [SAYS] so let's go there, it's still cheaper than Italy for example. [EOU] Marsha [SAYS] exactly! [EOU]
Adelina [SAYS] Hi handsome. [EOU] Where you you come from? [EOU] Cyprien [SAYS] What do you mean? [EOU] Adelina [SAYS] What do you mean, "what do you mean"? [EOU] It's a simple question, where do you come from? [EOU] Cyprien [SAYS] Well I was born in Jarrow, live in London now, so you could say I came from either of those places [EOU] I was educated in Loughborouogh, so in a sense I came from there. [EOU] Adelina [SAYS] OK. [EOU] Cyprien [SAYS] In another sense I come from my mother's vagina, but I dare say everyone can say that. [EOU] Adelina [SAYS] Are you all right? [EOU] Cyprien [SAYS] IN another sense I come from the atoms in the air that I breath or the food I eat, which comes to me from many places, so all I can say is "I come from Planet Earth". [EOU] Adelina [SAYS] OK, bye. [EOU] If you're gonna be a dick... [EOU] Cyprien [SAYS] Wait, what you got against earthlings? [EOU]
Joanna [SAYS] I need to get the coffie stains out of my dress [EOU] Do you know any effective methods? [EOU] Ethel [SAYS] What color is this dress? [EOU] Joanna [SAYS] It's ecru and the fabric is very soft. [EOU] Ethel [SAYS] Well, in such a case I wouldn't recommend fixing it by yourself because you can ruin the dress... [EOU] Better leave it at the dry-cleaner's. [EOU] Joanna [SAYS] You might be right, just hope it won't cost me an arm and a leg... [EOU] Ethel [SAYS] There's a cheap one at Jagiellonska 3, they cleaned up all the stains from my favourite dress :) [EOU] Joanna [SAYS] Alright then, I'll give it a try, thanks Ethel! [EOU] :) [EOU]
Anna [SAYS] Hi, would you like to have a pizza with us tonight? [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] No thanks, I don't want to appear rude, but you know I'm still upset about all the things that happened.

[EOU] Enrique [SAYS] Thanks again! [EOU] It was really interesting! [EOU] Farrah [SAYS] Of course! [EOU] Any time, and now I have a better idea of other ones to bring next time. [EOU] Enrique [SAYS] That would be great. [EOU] Farrah [SAYS] Some of the questions really made me wish I had brought my whole collection, but that just isn't practical. [EOU] Enrique [SAYS] Oh, I understand. [EOU] I'm sure you'll do fine next time with whatever you bring. [EOU] Farrah [SAYS] Thanks! [EOU] Enrique [SAYS] Our pleasure! [EOU]

James [SAYS] hi girls! [EOU] When are you flying to Japan? [EOU] Mary [SAYS] in a week! [EOU] unbelievable 🎉 [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] I can't believe either. [EOU] I am also increasingly scared. [EOU] Mary [SAYS] you're such an alarmist! [EOU] James [SAYS] But scared of what?? [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] the long flight, earth-quakes [EOU] God, and tsunamis! [EOU] James [SAYS] hahaha, you're really a damn alarmist [EOU] this is so exaggerated, are you serious? [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] James, I almost never travel, I'm afraid really. [EOU] James [SAYS] Listen, nothing will happen. [EOU] First of all the earthquakes happen rarely, even in Japan and only in certain places [EOU] it's not like the whole country is shaking all the time. [EOU] Mary [SAYS] I'm telling her this all the time, but it's pointless. [EOU] James [SAYS] And, most of all, Japanese have amazing architecture because of their experiences with earthquakes. [EOU] Their cities are super safe. [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] What about tsunamis? [EOU] James [SAYS] Are you going to be at the coast even? [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] Mary, are we? [EOU] Mary [SAYS] I doubt. [EOU] maybe for 2 hours somewhere close to Tokyo. [EOU] James [SAYS] So I don't think the next tsunami in Japan will happen exactly at that place and time, relax and enjoy [EOU] Japan is really an amazing country. [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] Thanks James :) [EOU]

Amber [SAYS] Hi Erin, guess what, John and Annie are coming back to London! [EOU] Erin [SAYS] Hi Amber, wow that's news. [EOU] What caused the change of plans? [EOU] Amber [SAYS] John lost his job in Germany! [EOU] Erin [SAYS] What :O Seriously? [EOU] Amber [SAYS] Yeah, his whole team got liquidated. [EOU] Erin [SAYS] No way!? [EOU] Amber [SAYS] Yeah, and he was the only one who received an offer from the company to be relocated back to London. [EOU] Erin [SAYS] OK, well at least he's not unemployed. [EOU] Amber [SAYS] But he didn't accept it. [EOU] Erin [SAYS] Why not?! [EOU] Amber [SAYS] B/c they only offered him the job after a month & during that time he started searching for a new one. [EOU] He got a better offer from a different IT company in London. [EOU] Erin [SAYS] Well good for him! [EOU] Since they weren't able to appreciate his work and they didn't offer him something right away. [EOU] Amber [SAYS] Exactly, but you know what this means for me? [EOU] Erin [SAYS] You're going to have to search for a new flat... [EOU] Amber [SAYS] Yup, we had an agreement that I would be renting their place until they returned from Germany. [EOU] But you know, they planned to be there for at least 5 yrs. [EOU] Erin [SAYS] I can imagine that Annie isn't happy with this turn of events. [EOU] Amber [SAYS] She's pretty pissed off. [EOU] I mean the plan was to save up for a house and only then come back to London. [EOU] She had already enrolled in German classes & they were starting to feel at home there. [EOU] Erin [SAYS] That's too bad. [EOU] Sometimes life turns out to be unpredictable. [EOU] If you need somewhere to stay for a while, you can always stay at my place. [EOU] Amber [SAYS] Thanks Erin! [EOU] Annie already told me not to worry, that I can stay with them until I don't find something new. [EOU] But I've already started searching. [EOU] Erin [SAYS] Good luck and let me know if you need any help! [EOU] Amber [SAYS] Thanks, ttyl. [EOU] Erin [SAYS] Bye! [EOU]

[EOU] Rose [SAYS] I can't wait. [EOU] I love making gifts for people! [EOU] Jake [SAYS] Yup. [EOU] Me too. [EOU]
Martha [SAYS] how do you feel about minimalism? [EOU] Jake [SAYS] I used to think it's total bullshit [EOU] like, it's still about spending [EOU] but it's about shifting the paradigm from buying cheap to buying expensive stuff. [EOU] Martha [SAYS] if expensive lives longer, ofc. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] right. [EOU] Martha [SAYS] I'm asking because I just saw this documentary about minimalism gurus [EOU] and I felt mixed about it. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] I think it's a good idea to buy things that will serve you longer [EOU] but it's so difficult to be mindful about everything you buy. [EOU] Martha [SAYS] I feel there are so many conflicting priorities when it comes to shopping [EOU] if you want to buy durable stuff you usually pick brands you know, big brands [EOU] and then it might not be fair trade product. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] take leather for example [EOU] if it's ecological it's cruelty free but it has higher carbon footprint than leather. [EOU] Martha [SAYS] huh. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] so your values clash all the time when you shop. [EOU] Martha [SAYS] :( [EOU]

Jaya [SAYS] Hello Ravi, I haven't seen your mother in the club for almost 4 months. [EOU] Is she fine? [EOU] Ravi:- She is not keeping well these days. [EOU] so sorry to hear that, what happened? [EOU] Ravi [SAYS] She has been suffering from knee pain for almost 5 years now and the doctor has asked her to restrict movement. [EOU] Jaya [SAYS] Any specific reason for the pain? [EOU] Ravi [SAYS] Its probably arthritis. [EOU] The doctor said that it can be controlled, but not cured completely. [EOU] Jaya [SAYS] Oh, she had always maintained a healthy lifestyle, I wonder how this happened. [EOU] Ravi [SAYS] She did have mild ache in her knees for the past few years but had been ignoring it. [EOU] Jaya [SAYS] Did you try naturopathy? [EOU] Ravi [SAYS] We tried almost everything. [EOU] Jaya [SAYS] Your mother is a strong lady. [EOU] She never gives up so easily. [EOU] Ravi [SAYS] She is still the same, however abiding by the doctor’s advice she prefers to stay at home most of the time. [EOU] Jaya [SAYS] Please ask her to take care and start feeling better soon. [EOU] Ravi [SAYS] Thanks. [EOU] I'll pass your wishes to her. [EOU]

[EOU] Lynn [SAYS] Yes true  [EOU] Steviee [SAYS] Hahahaha. [EOU] Wilbur [SAYS] Not all of them expect intimacy some of them just want your company lol. [EOU] Justin [SAYS] Steviee, that's what lots of sugar babies say and want the public to believe, doesn't mean its true. [EOU] I don't believe what you said for a second [EOU]

Jeff [SAYS] Have you heard about this Christmas at Wall Street? [EOU] Peter [SAYS] Yup, was apparently the worst since the end of the 19th century. [EOU] Miranda [SAYS] but it's bounced back since, no panic. [EOU] Jeff [SAYS] I've listened to some radio podcasts about the American economy [EOU] and it's pretty scary, I mean the economic war on China that Trump is waging and all his unpredictability [EOU] but I'm not an economist. [EOU] Peter [SAYS] I know, it's hard to say what may happen because Trump is rather unpredictable [EOU] But people in my bank seem calm, at least 2019 should be calm. [EOU] Miranda [SAYS] yup, calm, but the global economy will get weaker [EOU] and the growth will be weaker but not tragic, I suppose. [EOU] Jeff [SAYS] and the EU? [EOU] How do you think? [EOU] Miranda [SAYS] We just don't know what will happen to the UK and with Brexit [EOU] There are many different scenarios possible [EOU] but it seems that 2020 may be much worse.

Samuel [SAYS] Are you there, Anna? [EOU] Tim [SAYS] I am, but I am not called Anna. [EOU] It's Tim. [EOU] Samuel [SAYS] Sorry, brother Tim. [EOU] Anna is just the word for elder brother in my language. [EOU] Tim [SAYS] It's a girl's name here. [EOU] Doesn't sound very brother-like. [EOU] Samuel [SAYS] My apologies. [EOU] Tim [SAYS] So what is your language? [EOU] Samuel [SAYS] It is Telugu, brother. [EOU] Tim [SAYS] is that spoken in India? [EOU] Samuel [SAYS] Yes, in South east India. [EOU] Bangalore and Chennai and other places. [EOU] Nearly 90 million speakers, brother. [EOU] Tim [SAYS] Is it one of those written right to left? [EOU] Samuel [SAYS] No, it is written left to right. [EOU] It is based on Brahmin script, our writing. [EOU] If you trace it back far enough it all comes from the Phoenicians, like English writing the same. [EOU] Tim [SAYS] Wow. [EOU] So it must be pretty big, then, Teluguland? [EOU] Samuel [SAYS] It is 23 provinces, Anna. [EOU] But we are not rich as in the north, so many people here are still working for less than a hundred dollars a whole month. [EOU] Tim [SAYS] So what is the word for "younger brother" if "Anna" means "elder brother?" [EOU] Samuel [SAYS] Thammu or Thammadu. [EOU] You can call me Thammu. [EOU] I am younger than you. [EOU] Tim [SAYS] how old are you, I would have sid about the same as me in your photo. [EOU] Samuel [SAYS] How old are you, Anna? [EOU] Tim [SAYS] 55 [EOU] Samuel [SAYS] Well there you are you see. [EOU] I am 35 only. [EOU] So you are my Anna and I am your Thammadu. [EOU] Tim [SAYS] Wow sorry to say it but you do look old for 35: [EOU] Samuel [SAYS] That is because it is not an easy life when you are not earning much money, Anna. [EOU] We work very hard and have very little. [EOU] But still we are thankful for what we do have. [EOU]
Pete [SAYS] What flavour yogurt did you want again? [EOU] My brain is like a sieve today. [EOU] Jen [SAYS] Pear but only if they've got it. [EOU] Otherwise don't worry about it.

[EOU] How is that even possible? [EOU] Shari [SAYS] I'm not sure. [EOU] I mean, he's breaking amendments to the constitution here! [EOU] Stewart [SAYS] Only on the fringe. [EOU] Shari [SAYS] Maybe. [EOU] Stewart [SAYS] We have to make the best of it now. [EOU] Nothing we can do. [EOU] Shari [SAYS] Except vote him out! [EOU] Stewart [SAYS] Exactly. [EOU] But that's not for a while.

[EOU] I can't believe he is still texting you, now... [EOU] When you know everything... [EOU] Lydia [SAYS] That's weird, I know. [EOU] Do you think I should talk to him? [EOU] Camila [SAYS] I wouldn't pull any punches. [EOU] Lydia [SAYS] But we work in the same company. [EOU] I don't want it to be awkward. [EOU] Camila [SAYS] You're kidding? [EOU] You should talk to him. [EOU] It's not fair what he's doing and it cannot be like that anymore! [EOU] Think about this girl! [EOU] Lydia [SAYS] Yeah, you're right.

[EOU] I'm jealous cause mine's only 65. [EOU] Dick [SAYS] :) [EOU] Frank [SAYS] If you decide to buy it, I have a contractor that does everything, and he's dirt cheap too! [EOU] Dick [SAYS] Cool, I'll be putting most of my cash in as a down payment, so I won't have much left for renovations. [EOU] Frank [SAYS] How much do you have, 10% or 15%. [EOU] Dick [SAYS] We're putting down 10. [EOU] We can get quite a good mortgage rate apparently. [EOU] Frank [SAYS] Alright, sounds good. [EOU] How many apts have you seen already? [EOU] Dick [SAYS] This will be the first one in this neighbourhood. [EOU] Frank [SAYS] But in total? [EOU] Dick [SAYS] 5. [EOU] We saw 2 last week and 3 last month, but nothing really appealing, [EOU] Frank [SAYS] You're gonna love my area. [EOU] It's so peaceful and tranquil. [EOU] Dick [SAYS] I'm gonna have to liven up the place then :) [EOU] Frank [SAYS] Ok, whatever. [EOU] Don't forget to bring a measure. [EOU] Do you have one of those electronic ones? [EOU] Dick [SAYS] No. [EOU] Frank [SAYS] I'll bring one then. [EOU] They're super cool and easy to use. [EOU] You can plan each room by knowing the dimensions. [EOU] Dick [SAYS] Ok, great. [EOU] See you in 30 min. [EOU] Frank [SAYS] Ok [EOU]

[EOU] Stu [SAYS] Right, so? [EOU] That's what I gave you on that disc. [EOU] Priscilla [SAYS] No, you silly boy, your IT friend is and idiot. [EOU] Stu [SAYS] What did Alex do wrong? [EOU] Priscilla [SAYS] He just downloaded Open Office and some other programs and put them on a CD. [EOU] Stu [SAYS] Whaaaaatttt?

[EOU] Rosemary [SAYS] you see [EOU] there's a problem. [EOU] Victoria [SAYS] yeah? [EOU] Rosemary [SAYS] namely, i don't have a working laptop atm. [EOU] Victoria [SAYS] XD [EOU] i have a tablet but it has 2gb ram, so probably not enough for recording. [EOU] Rosemary [SAYS] but does it have all the software? [EOU] usb ports? [EOU] windows? [EOU] Victoria [SAYS] yeah it's running windows 10 [EOU] Rosemary [SAYS] still 2gb is probably not enough [EOU] so we need to borrow it from somebody. [EOU] Victoria [SAYS] yeah, any ideas?

[EOU] I seem to have so many sunglasses... [EOU] 8‑D. [EOU] Phil [SAYS] Where did you find them, possible that they belong to Adrian? [EOU] Deana [SAYS] In this empty place above the radio. [EOU] In the very back. [EOU] If Adrian wants it, no pro! [EOU] :) [EOU] Phil [SAYS] :)) [EOU] Deana [SAYS] Exactly! [EOU] Phil [SAYS] Ok, they don't belong to any of us, and nobody else drove your car. [EOU] But we can look after these sunglasses. [EOU] Deana [SAYS] Glad to hear it! [EOU]

Kelly [SAYS] Oh! [EOU] Oh! [EOU] Can I pick the first question? [EOU] Jessica [SAYS] Sure. [EOU] Go for it! [EOU] Kelly [SAYS] What's the scariest place you've been to! [EOU] Jessica [SAYS] I'll start: Palermo in Italy. [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] And what's so scary about that? [EOU] Did you break your nail? [EOU] :P. [EOU] Jessica [SAYS] Shut it, Mickey! [EOU] No, there are the Capuchin Catacombs with 8000 corpses! [EOU] Kelly [SAYS] Ewwww! [EOU] Corpses? [EOU] Rly? [EOU] Jessica [SAYS] Yeah! [EOU] And you can look at them like museum exhibits. [EOU] I think they're divided somehow, but have no clue how! [EOU] Ollie [SAYS] That's so cool! [EOU] Do you get to see the bones or are they covered up? [EOU] Jessica [SAYS] Well, partly. [EOU] Most of them were exhibited in their clothes. [EOU] Basically only skulls and hands. [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] I'm writing this one down! [EOU] That's so precious! [EOU] Ollie [SAYS] Me too! [EOU]
Maria [SAYS] Hi Spence, life treating you well? [EOU] Spencer [SAYS] Can't complain love, lots of commissions coming in and all that! [EOU] Maria [SAYS] Getting your name out there! [EOU] Saw some of your new stuff on Instagram, liked it! [EOU] Spencer [SAYS] Yeah, thanks love! [EOU] How's the call centre? [EOU] Maria [SAYS] Same old, same old. [EOU] Can't wait to go part time next year, really want to get on with some freelancing. [EOU] Spencer [SAYS] Yeah, pity they won't allow it for a year. [EOU] I'm on 16 fixed hours at the cafe which suits me great. [EOU] I've then got the rest of the week to work on my illustrations. [EOU] Maria [SAYS] How do you get new clients, Spence? [EOU] I really need to pick your brains sometimes! [EOU] Spencer [SAYS] Well, some of them saw my printing in the shops I sell to and contacted me directly, then there's the agency and my social media stuff. [EOU] I probably get around £1000 of work a month now, before commission and tax. [EOU] Maria [SAYS] Well that's just about liveable with the cafe wage, I imagine. [EOU] Spencer [SAYS] Yes, it's tight, but I am very frugal. [EOU] Still have a hefty chunk going out on rent and bills. [EOU] Maria [SAYS] Hmm, I'll have to budget carefully when I do it. [EOU] Spencer [SAYS] Yes, but it's well worth it. [EOU] I LOVE the work so much! [EOU] Maria [SAYS] Well, your passion is obvious! [EOU] Your stuff is amazing! [EOU] Spencer [SAYS] Well, so was yours in Uni. [EOU] Don't let your talent go to waste! [EOU] Maria [SAYS] You've inspired me, Spence. [EOU] See you soon, hopefully! [EOU] Spencer [SAYS] See ya! [EOU]
Tim [SAYS] Hey, you have a few minutes? [EOU] Joe [SAYS] Sure, what's up? [EOU] Tim [SAYS] I'm thinking about inviting a few people from work over and I kinda thought that maybe some boardgames would be a cool idea. [EOU] And I wanted to consult the expert on the matter :) [EOU] Joe [SAYS] As you know I'm always happy to share my expertise with anyone willing to listen. [EOU] You will just need to stop me when I get too wound up :D [EOU] Tim [SAYS] Haha :) Ok, So I know you ran the local club - any tips how to organize a newbie gaming evening? [EOU] And what games to bring? [EOU] Joe [SAYS] yeah, sure - just a few general tips :) [EOU] Start games before you start drinking :) And don't bring any game that is either over-complicated, requires too much time to explain, or god forbid encourages direct conflict - you know, the plotting-scheming stuff. [EOU] So no Game of Thrones :) [EOU] Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic. [EOU] Tim [SAYS] Got it :D [EOU] Joe [SAYS] Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. [EOU] And if not then there are some 'vanilla' games - like Codenames or Catan. [EOU] Any idea what they might be into? [EOU] Tim [SAYS] Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls... [EOU] Joe [SAYS] The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. [EOU] Maybe some of them are already into gaming? [EOU] There are nerds in every walk of life :) [EOU] Tim [SAYS] Yeah, I know, all too well :) [EOU] Anyway, thanks for the tips - co-op games sound like a good idea for a start. [EOU] Joe [SAYS] yeah, and then if the idea sticks you can roll out the big guns :) [EOU] Tim [SAYS] Will do that :) [EOU]
Richard [SAYS] Hey we have to start [EOU] doing our project real soon. [EOU] Holy [SAYS] When is it due? [EOU] Richard [SAYS] 15 dec.

Russ [SAYS] Hi Gurdun, are you feeling better? [EOU] Gurdun [SAYS] Hi Ross, a little bit better, yes, thank you. [EOU] Russ [SAYS] Do you think you'll be back at the uni this week? [EOU] Gurdun [SAYS] Not tomorrow for sure, but I hope Wednesday maybe. [EOU] Russ [SAYS] Oh, that's fine. [EOU] Gurdun [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] I'm feeling a bit weak still. [EOU] Russ [SAYS] I guess that's pretty normal at this stage. [EOU] Gurdun [SAYS] I believe so. [EOU] And the muscle pain. [EOU] Russ [SAYS] I know what you mean. [EOU] I had flu like that three months ago. [EOU] Gurdun [SAYS] Luckily the headache's gone. [EOU] It was absolutely awful. [EOU] Russ [SAYS] True enough. [EOU] I had the same. [EOU] Gurdun [SAYS] Anyway, how are things with you? [EOU] Russ [SAYS] Same old, same old, you know. [EOU] Not much happening in the middle of term. [EOU] Gurdun [SAYS] And the team? [EOU] Russ [SAYS] Oh yeah, we won the last match. [EOU] It was a good game. [EOU] Gurdun [SAYS] Great. [EOU] Listen Russ, I need to run. [EOU] Catch up later. [EOU] Russ [SAYS] OK, talk to you later. [EOU]
Leo [SAYS] Check this out [EOU] <file_video> [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] Whaaaaaaaat. [EOU] Oliver [SAYS] God [EOU] What's that?? [EOU] Leo [SAYS] Seems like prank [EOU] But actually I dunno xD. [EOU] Oliver [SAYS] 03:24 [EOU] WTF. [EOU] Leo [SAYS] Hahahah, my fav part [EOU] Of that random crap. [EOU] Oliver [SAYS] People are so weird sometimes. [EOU] Leo [SAYS] I knew you'd like it xD. [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] Wellllllll I have mixed feelings :D:D [EOU] Leo [SAYS] Hahahahah, wait till 05:24 [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] Omg, too much for me [EOU] My eyes!! [EOU] Leo [SAYS] Hahahahahah [EOU] xDDDDDD [EOU]

Dan [SAYS] buy me a sandwich on your way to work. [EOU] Kevin [SAYS] ok, no problem! [EOU] Dan [SAYS] thanks! [EOU]
Simon [SAYS] <file_photo> [EOU] It's funny and scary at the same time. [EOU] BTW it's so annoying that people can't see that such immigration policy reduces safety level for citizens of EU significantly. [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] This photo is great. [EOU] It totally shows what do we all mean when we criticize EU policy. [EOU] Berlin has put concrete blocks around Christmas fair, Belgium has soldiers running armed around cities and Paris has mass demonstrations and car arsons happening all over the city. [EOU] Poland though... [EOU] One of the last countries unspoilt by uncontrolled migration and terrorism [EOU] The question is - for how long... [EOU] Simon [SAYS] I always say that there is advantage of the polish situation [EOU] I mean being economically delayed for few decades [EOU] Poland has a chance to develop in fast pace and at the same time has a position to avoid all the mistakes other western powers made. [EOU] The worst thing is that the country is being ostracized by defending it's values and interests. [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] Yup. [EOU] And as long as there are people in Poland ready to defend that values, the country will be marginalized by every other nation. [EOU] Simon [SAYS] I admire Poles. [EOU] I admire them for they will to fight. [EOU] They never give up. [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] Different countries tried to eliminate them from the map. [EOU] Simon [SAYS] I tell you, there will be time, when only Poland will have power to fight with internal problems of Europe. [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] Maybe. [EOU] But there is a risk that internal conflict will rip the country apart. [EOU] Simon [SAYS] Let's hope not. [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] Yup. [EOU] To conclude: Christmas in Poland will be the best Christmas in Europe :D [EOU] Simon [SAYS] I agree :) [EOU]
Sam [SAYS] Where are you? [EOU] Tilly [SAYS] Just leaving school now? [EOU] Sam [SAYS] What have you been doing? [EOU] You said you would be home for 4! [EOU] Tilly [SAYS] Yes had to go for detention. [EOU] Sam [SAYS] I asked your mum if that's what had happened but she said she hadn't got a text. [EOU] Tilly [SAYS] They are useless. [EOU] They are supposed to tell your parents if you get a detention. [EOU] Sam [SAYS] How long will you be? [EOU] Tilly [SAYS] About 40 minutes. [EOU] Sam [SAYS] OK.. [EOU] I'm going back to mine - phone me when you are home. [EOU] Tilly [SAYS] OK - see you soon. [EOU]
Mell [SAYS] Hi there! [EOU] How are you doing? [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] Hi Mell! [EOU] We are fine, just the daily grind ;) And yourselves? [EOU] Mell [SAYS] Not much happening either. [EOU] An odd phone call with the kids. [EOU] Or Tad's sister:(( Not much otherwise. [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] Yeah... [EOU] Life has become so quite since the kids are out of the house. [EOU] We had more to get used to it. [EOU] But it must hard for you. [EOU] Especially you I mean. [EOU] Mell [SAYS] I don't know. [EOU] Sometimes I even forget that I should be missing them. [EOU] In a way I do like this peace and quiet now. [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] Small wonder. [EOU] You had a hell of a time with them just before they went to college. [EOU] I'd say you need to recover now. [EOU] Mell [SAYS] I guess you're right. [EOU] But maybe I should feel guilty or something? [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] Don't be silly! [EOU] You are a fantastic mom. [EOU] Mell [SAYS] Thanks Gloria. [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] Anyway I'm happy to hear from you again. [EOU] We should really have a nice do again. [EOU] Mell [SAYS] YES! [EOU] Splendid! [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] The weather is just brilliant, perfect for a BBQ. [EOU] What do you think? [EOU] Mell [SAYS] I'm all for it. [EOU] At my place? [EOU] I'd love it. [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] Can't be better. [EOU] I love your garden. [EOU] Mell [SAYS] We're thinking about extending the terrace. [EOU] I must show you my drawings, just a few ideas. [EOU] It would be great to hear your opinion. [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] I'd love to. [EOU] But you know how little I know about garden design, or however you call it. [EOU] Mell [SAYS] We'll have a look at them. [EOU] Now the BBQ. [EOU] At the weekend I suppose? [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] Let me check the calendar. [EOU] Here's our family planner. [EOU] A horrible name, isn't it? [EOU] So this weekend suits us fine. [EOU] At the next one, on Saturday, Mark has penciled something in but I can't read it. [EOU] So what about this Saturday? [EOU] Mell [SAYS] Perfect. [EOU] At least we know the weather holds. [EOU] Shall I do the food and you the drinks? [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] And I'll get us some dessert as well. [EOU] Mell [SAYS] Very good indeed. [EOU] It's always so easy going with you. [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] Ta! [EOU] You were thinking about Tad's sister? [EOU] Mell [SAYS] I'm afraid so. [EOU] I'm so happy she moved up to Scotland and I don't have to put up with her trying to run my household. [EOU] Tad feels relieved too. [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] Good riddance! [EOU] I could really never warm up to her. [EOU] Mell [SAYS] Nobody can! [EOU] Anyway she's gone and we're going to have a fantastic barbecue. [EOU] Without her. [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] Yes, we are. [EOU] Oh I'm so happy you've phoned! [EOU] Mell [SAYS] Looking forward to our BBQ on Saturday! [EOU] Gloria [SAYS] So long! [EOU]

[EOU] Whitney [SAYS] Mmmh maybe [EOU] But it all depends if you will be available the day Aqua man is being released. [EOU] Hailey [SAYS] I'll break the laws to make time for it😂 [EOU] Whitney [SAYS] Haha. [EOU] Then it is a deal. [EOU] Hailey [SAYS] Cool.

[EOU] Jackie [SAYS] But I am a bit worried about her.(ーー゛)(ーー゛) [EOU] Deadrana [SAYS] Why? [EOU] As I know your sister is healthy. [EOU] Does she have any problem? [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] No, no. [EOU] Of course not. [EOU] You know nowadays having kids and raise them takes a lot of money for whole your life. [EOU] Deadrana [SAYS] That’s true. [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] But I don't think my brother-in-law earns enough money for his kids. [EOU] Deadrana [SAYS] At least he doesn’t have any debt. [EOU] I understand you are worried about your sister (・へ・) [EOU] Cause she is your sister but your brother-in-law is hardworking guy. [EOU] 🙂🙂 [EOU] Don’t worry too much.🙂 [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] My sister seemed also worried while she was talking about her pregnancy. [EOU] Deadrana [SAYS] I can imagine....🙁🙁 [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] Because her plan was to have a baby 2 years later. [EOU] So it is like, so to speak, well, an accident.😢😢😢 [EOU] Deadrana [SAYS] I understand. [EOU] But life isn’t going only as you expected. [EOU] Right? [EOU] Maybe you can just say only bright future. [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] Yeah..I guess you’re right. [EOU] <_<<_<<_< [EOU] Sometimes I feel lucky that I didn't get married yet.ヽ(´ー｀)┌ [EOU]

[EOU] but there is a very important question: are we going to share them with you? [EOU] Sean [SAYS] nooooo.... [EOU] how cruel. [EOU] Mike [SAYS] we all like to sleep, but we keep going there anyway. [EOU] Sean [SAYS] I think I like to sleep more [EOU] I'm just unable to get up so early. [EOU] Joseph [SAYS] so are we! [EOU] Try at leat once, then we can think about sharing the notes. [EOU] Sean [SAYS] how mean... [EOU]

[EOU] Anna [SAYS] Maybe. [EOU] I'm not sure. [EOU] Joanna [SAYS] What did you have for breakfast? [EOU] Anna [SAYS] The usual, cereal with milk and a banana. [EOU] Joanna [SAYS] Maybe the milk was bad. [EOU] Anna [SAYS] It didn't smell bad. [EOU] Joanna [SAYS] Maybe the banana was bad. [EOU] Anna [SAYS] No, the banana was delicious. [EOU] Joanna [SAYS] Maybe you just need to go to the bathroom. [EOU] Anna [SAYS] No, that's not the problem. [EOU] Joanna [SAYS] Maybe it will go away in a little while. [EOU] Anna [SAYS] I wish it would :-( [EOU] Hopefully. [EOU] If not, maybe we should go and see a doctor. [EOU] Joanna [SAYS] Yeah, I think so... [EOU] Anna [SAYS] I’ll get you a hot tea with some fresh mint leaves. [EOU] Hope it will help. [EOU] Joanna [SAYS] Please do, I’m in my room... [EOU] Anna [SAYS] Will be in ten minutes:-) [EOU]

Larry [SAYS] "old heads" will hear insurance and their ears will prick up. [EOU] This vote isn't about converting people we already have onboard :) [EOU] Kirsten [SAYS] Agreed.

[EOU] Larry [SAYS] Let me take a look at that email and get back to u. [EOU] Kirsten [SAYS] Ok. [EOU] sounds good. [EOU] And let me know what you think and I will pull the trigger and post.

[EOU] I would be a fool not to take input fro Jamie and John. [EOU] They all have a lot of experience and knowledge in the role. [EOU] Larry [SAYS] I hear that too. [EOU] No argument from me. [EOU] The current BoD has ignored them both. [EOU] It's insulting. [EOU] Kirsten [SAYS] Legal action seems to be the only thing they understand. [EOU] Larry [SAYS] Sadly yes.

[EOU] No one is going to be home for a long time. [EOU] Someone needs to come home and let her out. [EOU] Chloe [SAYS] Mom, you always do this to me. [EOU] Lesley [SAYS] I am not the one that wanted a dog. [EOU] You are going to come home and let her out. [EOU] And that's that. [EOU] You can go out and see Megan afterwards. [EOU] Chloe [SAYS] Ok.

Mia [SAYS] God, he keeps talking about the stupid wall. [EOU] Jennifer [SAYS] I think he's just senile. [EOU] Karine [SAYS] unfortunately it's much more [EOU] this populist strategy to scare people with a minority [EOU] and then present himself as the only savior. [EOU] Peter [SAYS] Karine is right, I think he's not as senile and stupid as we would like to believe. [EOU] Mia [SAYS] so it's even worse - he's pure evil. [EOU] Peter [SAYS] possibly yes. [EOU] Karine [SAYS] I really think so, because it's not only about politics anymore [EOU] he is destroying the Earth [EOU] trying to shake the world's order. [EOU] Jennifer [SAYS] but he's also quite stupid [EOU] and the dangerous thing is his self confidence [EOU] he's persistence [EOU] and ignorance. [EOU] Karine [SAYS] but we have a chance to change it [EOU] maybe Trump will be over soon? [EOU] Mia [SAYS] we will see [EOU] but we should do anything to win the next elections. [EOU] Karine [SAYS] everything! [EOU]

Andy [SAYS] Hello. [EOU] I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] Hello Andy. [EOU] Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? [EOU] Andy [SAYS] I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] Why is that? [EOU] Andy [SAYS] Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. [EOU] On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? [EOU] but not in other rooms? [EOU] Andy [SAYS] Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] so why only that bedroom and not the other ones? [EOU] Andy [SAYS] I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then? [EOU] Andy [SAYS] I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. [EOU] The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation? [EOU] Andy [SAYS] Not necessarily. [EOU] that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] So what would you recommend? [EOU] Andy [SAYS] I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. [EOU] It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] That sounds good. [EOU] would that be sufficient? [EOU] Andy [SAYS] If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. [EOU] That will not go away by itself. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] OK, is this something your company can help with? [EOU] Andy [SAYS] It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] Good point. [EOU] Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email? [EOU] Andy [SAYS] Of course, I will have that done by Friday. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] That would be great. [EOU] And again, thanks for today! [EOU] Andy [SAYS] No problem, speak soon. [EOU]
Gina [SAYS] did u lock the door. [EOU] Warren [SAYS] yes. [EOU] Gina [SAYS] good, thanks [EOU]
Claire [SAYS] hey [EOU] where's this conference about relations at school? [EOU] Aaron [SAYS] hey [EOU] it's in the teaching training thing. [EOU] Claire [SAYS] oh, in Sesame Street?

[EOU] Aaron [SAYS] i was thinking i could go to Jo's lecture. [EOU] Claire [SAYS] Jo's... [EOU] is it the one about stress? [EOU] Aaron [SAYS] no, that's Joe ;D Jo is having a workshop on teamwork. [EOU] Claire [SAYS] ah, this one. [EOU] yeah looks interesting. [EOU] Aaron [SAYS] i know her, she's a really good coach. [EOU] Claire [SAYS] i was thinking maybe mindfullness... [EOU] Aaron [SAYS] yeah definitely!! [EOU] if you haven't been to any mindfullness workshops then it's a must! [EOU] i've taken it in Berlin last year, with the same guy [EOU] it was amazing, life-changing i'd say. [EOU] Claire [SAYS] sounds wonderful [EOU] one can easily tell you're one of the organisers ;D.

Kate [SAYS] I've just heard you want to sell your flat?! [EOU] Rob [SAYS] That's true. [EOU] Do you want to buy it? [EOU] Kate [SAYS] Ha ha! [EOU] I wish.. [EOU] Rob [SAYS] I'll give you a discount ;) [EOU] Kate [SAYS] Sure. [EOU] You moved in a year ago or so?! [EOU] Why do you wanna sell it? [EOU] Rob [SAYS] We're thinking about having a baby and it is too small. [EOU] Kate [SAYS] It's not that bad. [EOU] Mine is smaller and I have two. [EOU] Rob [SAYS] There's no room for a cot in our bedroom. [EOU] Kate [SAYS] You're right. [EOU] So are you looking for two bed now? [EOU] Rob [SAYS] Three bed would be perfect so that we won't have to move out again when we decide to have another baby. [EOU] Kate [SAYS] That's sounds reasonable. [EOU] Rob [SAYS] I know. [EOU] It just the prices.. [EOU] total madness!!! [EOU] Kate [SAYS] I can only imagine. [EOU] It's getting more expensive year after year. [EOU] Rob [SAYS] I've got a friend who's relocating to another city so want to sell his flat ASAP and offers a good price. [EOU] We're seeing him tomorrow. [EOU] Kate [SAYS] Good luck with that! [EOU] ;) [EOU] Rob [SAYS] Fingers crossed! [EOU] ;) [EOU]

[EOU] Paisley [SAYS] leg waxing was ok-ish, but bikini... [EOU] jesus [EOU] i was bleeding so fckin hard [EOU] blood was EVERYWHERE. [EOU] Violet [SAYS] !!! [EOU] i was going to get brazilian waxing, but now i'm scared. [EOU] Paisley [SAYS] that's extreme :o [EOU] if i were you, i'd start from leg waxing or sugaring [EOU] but why won't you just shave down there? [EOU] ingrown hairs? [EOU] Violet [SAYS] yup [EOU] i use scrubs and moisturize my skin almost every day but it's still bad [EOU] i mean REALLY BAD, i look like a freaking chicken with all these razor bumps. [EOU] Paisley [SAYS] try shaving with the grain [EOU] it helped with my ingrows. [EOU] Violet [SAYS] i've tried everything [EOU] i just need to man up and make an appointment. [EOU] Paisley [SAYS] good luck, then ;) [EOU] Violet [SAYS] thanks [EOU]
Suzy [SAYS] don't forget to follow me on Instagram :P. [EOU] Linda [SAYS] do I need to? [EOU] :P. [EOU] Suzy [SAYS] come on, nice pictures ;) [EOU] Linda [SAYS] done. [EOU] Suzy [SAYS] :) [EOU] Linda [SAYS] you're welcome ;) [EOU]
Sean [SAYS] Friendly reminder of trade deadline today. [EOU] Let's get those last minute trade request sent. [EOU] Rick [SAYS] So does John get Lamar Jackson or is he scrambling for another qb?? [EOU] Sean [SAYS] Nick needs to really think about rolling with Blake. [EOU] John needs a QB! [EOU] John [SAYS] I think I would have rights to Lamar but I think the consensus is that he's on waivers so he's open. [EOU] I guess I'm just hoping RGIII and Brock play or just wait... [EOU] Rick [SAYS] Crazy it happens though! [EOU] he one thing in the chart that isn't addressed. [EOU] We could vote and go from there. [EOU] I just want you to lose a player and Nick not to get Lamar. [EOU] John [SAYS] In 15 years I've never seen a ream trade a big time RB or WR for a QB this late n the season do anything in the playoffs. [EOU] That ends their season. [EOU] Of course a one QB team isn't worth anything either. [EOU] I have t take my chances. [EOU] Sean [SAYS] Damned if you do, damned if you don't. [EOU] Rick [SAYS] people's evidence #658 why the QB rule doesn't work. [EOU] John [SAYS] I might have a way to drop the rule completely next year. [EOU] Sean [SAYS] I guess we will have to talk about after the season. [EOU] Rick [SAYS] Nobody liked my IR suggestion a couple of years ago. [EOU] That solves a large percentage of the issue tho. [EOU] Sean [SAYS] 1 QB not 2 for a 14 league... [EOU] John [SAYS] as I said, we can look at if after the season. [EOU] I just wouldn't want to make it any easier. [EOU] What has made the league so great its that it has been really difficult so far. [EOU]
Lisa [SAYS] have you ever heard about this diet?? [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] Victoria [SAYS] Nooo [EOU] Hmm, seems interesting. [EOU] Amelia [SAYS] YES!! [EOU] My mum was on that crazy diet..... [EOU] She gained 5 pounds (ー_ー)!! [EOU] Lisa [SAYS] omg, glad that I asked [EOU] <file_gif>  [EOU]
Carrie [SAYS] Just back from Fantastic Beast :) [EOU] Gina [SAYS] and what do you think? [EOU] Carrie [SAYS] generally good - as usual nice special effect and visuals, an ok plot, a glimpse of the wizarding community in the US. [EOU] Alex [SAYS] Sounds cool. [EOU] I was thinking of going this weekend with Lane, but I've seen some bad reviews. [EOU] Carrie [SAYS] Depends on what you expect really - I have a lot of sentiment towards Harry Potter so, I'm gonna like everything the do. [EOU] But seriously the movie was decent. [EOU] However, if you're expecting to have your mind blown, then no, it's not THAT good. [EOU] Gina [SAYS] I agree. [EOU] I saw it last week and basically I'm satisfied. [EOU] Alex [SAYS] No spoilers, girls. [EOU] Carrie [SAYS] no worries ;) [EOU] And Gina, what do you think about Eddie Redmayne as Newt? [EOU] Gina [SAYS] I loved him <3 I loved how introverted and awkward he was and how caring he was towards the animals. [EOU] And with all that he showed a lot of confidence in his beliefs and was a genuinely compassionate character. [EOU] Carrie [SAYS] not your standard protagonist, that's for sure. [EOU] Gina [SAYS] and that's what I liked about him. [EOU] Alex [SAYS] Maybe I'll go and see it sooner so we can all talk about it. [EOU] Carrie [SAYS] go see it. [EOU] If' you're not expecting god-knows-what you're going to enjoy it ;) [EOU]
Amelia [SAYS] What is your favourite colour? [EOU] Emily [SAYS] Blue, why? [EOU] Amelia [SAYS] I can't tell you. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] A surprise? [EOU] =) [EOU] Amelia [SAYS] Sort of... [EOU] Can't tell you anything more [EOU] Sorry. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] I'm super curious [EOU]

[EOU] Sid [SAYS] He got fired 2day and thrown out of school? [EOU] Oliver [SAYS] Literally thrown out! [EOU] Shanon [SAYS] What?! [EOU] Victor [SAYS] I suppose he's had it and lost it. [EOU] Oliver [SAYS] Or maybe had one too many ;) [EOU] Sid [SAYS] Not. [EOU] Our. [EOU] Teacher. [EOU] Anymore! [EOU]

[EOU] Pedro [SAYS] whats so good about the flash :P. [EOU] Alex [SAYS] duuude, he can do almost anything. [EOU] Pedro [SAYS] not anything. [EOU] Alex [SAYS] yea im sure batman can run as fast -_- [EOU] Pedro [SAYS] superhuman speed? [EOU] thats your pitch? [EOU] Alex [SAYS] that speed opens up the whole multiverse for him.. [EOU] you seriously dont get how powerful he can be. [EOU] Pedro [SAYS] yeah i get your point [EOU]
Marek [SAYS] bro, check this out [EOU] <file_picture> [EOU] Adam [SAYS] whoa, that's some fine piece of ass [EOU] where did you find it?

[EOU] Adam [SAYS] dude, that's creppy [EOU] one thing is to send me pic of nice ass, it's always appreciated [EOU] but another is to walk around and take pictures on your own [EOU] like some creep [EOU] think about it, she might have been someone's sister or daughter. [EOU] Marek [SAYS] dude [EOU] this is some guy's ass [EOU] I'm a gay, remember? [EOU] Adam [SAYS] shit [EOU]

[EOU] Bart [SAYS] Well, I bombed my economy final and ended up with a bad score.. [EOU] Adrian [SAYS] Ouch. [EOU] That must hurt :/ [EOU] Bart [SAYS] Well, it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have. [EOU] Adrian [SAYS] Why don't you re-take the class next year? [EOU] Bart [SAYS] That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up. [EOU] How did you do this semester? [EOU] Adrian [SAYS] I didn't do that bad. [EOU] I ended up with a reasonable grade. [EOU] Bart [SAYS] Well someone did his homework :p. [EOU] Adrian [SAYS] I just pay attention during class, I don't study that much actually. [EOU] Bart [SAYS] Classes are boring, can't pay attention for too long... [EOU] Adrian [SAYS] Anyway, why didn't you study for the economy final? [EOU] Bart [SAYS] Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class. [EOU] Adrian [SAYS] What happened? [EOU] Bart [SAYS] I started playing StarCraft and ended up wasting a lot of time. [EOU] Adrian [SAYS] Oooohh I know that game but you better stop slacking off. [EOU] Bart [SAYS] You're right. [EOU] I'm not going to play games during school anymore.

Sean [SAYS] After much thought I’ve decided that my spirit animal is a tortoise. [EOU] Apparently everyone has one now, I only found out about this recently. [EOU] Tbh I felt lost, like who even am I? [EOU] After many days of thinking about I finally decided that I am in fact a tortoise. [EOU] Tiffany [SAYS] That would explain a lot. [EOU] Sean [SAYS] You would be a wasp. [EOU] Tiffany [SAYS] Are you sure you're a turtle? [EOU] Maybe you're just haunted. [EOU]

[EOU] Nathan [SAYS] i was thinking of hanging it on the wall, there are some special hooks. [EOU] Aubrey [SAYS] you can always keep it in the hallway. [EOU] Nathan [SAYS] i don't want to, people who do that annoy me, it's hard to walk around with all these bikes striped to the handrails. [EOU] Aubrey [SAYS] i agree... [EOU] didn't think about that. [EOU] Nathan [SAYS] yeah, well I also got a stationary bike so I can be in shape during winter :D [EOU] Aubrey [SAYS] really? [EOU] I am so proud of you!! [EOU] Nathan [SAYS] ye, I do like 25 kilometers everyday. [EOU] Aubrey [SAYS] that's a lot! [EOU] Nathan [SAYS] my goal for the summer is 100 kilometers. [EOU] Aubrey [SAYS] fingers crossed! [EOU]

[EOU] At airport on my way back. [EOU] looong trip. [EOU] Kai [SAYS] where have you been now? [EOU] Michael [SAYS] argentina brazil and chile. [EOU] Kai [SAYS] wow! [EOU] how long? [EOU] Michael [SAYS] 2 weeks, lots of flights to make it work. [EOU] I'm in Boston next weekend! [EOU] Kai [SAYS] really??! [EOU] how come? [EOU] Michael [SAYS] just because I found a cheap ticket 😋 [EOU] Kai [SAYS] nice:) but it's cold. [EOU] Michael [SAYS] hmm well.. [EOU] I can deal with the cold now. [EOU] Kai [SAYS] are you not tired of all this travelling? [EOU] Michael [SAYS] hmm, a little bit but not really. [EOU] I’m more scared to stay in London and do nothing, because I’m so bored of it. [EOU] Kai [SAYS] I see, a man full of energy :) [EOU] Michael [SAYS] well sort of, for fun stuff, but tired of work. [EOU] Kai [SAYS] yes, I remember quite well 😋 [EOU] Michael [SAYS] Hahah. [EOU] Thinking of resigning earlier than I was planning. [EOU] Kai [SAYS] and then? [EOU] Michael [SAYS] I don’t have an answer to that one yet, and it’s not really a solution because I’d need to work 2 months notice period anyway, but I’ve just lost motivation after 3 years. [EOU] Kai [SAYS] Would you like to leave London? [EOU] Michael [SAYS] yes asap. [EOU] Kai [SAYS] for the Netherlands? [EOU] Michael [SAYS] maybe to recharge and look for jobs abroad, but I don't want to stay there. [EOU] I know it’s not smart to quit without an alternative. [EOU] Kai [SAYS] depends on the field. [EOU] I don't know yours and your experience. [EOU] But it can be a bit stressful also. [EOU] Michael [SAYS] true, in my field it wouldn’t be good. [EOU] Anyway I need to speak to my manager and discuss because I’m not happy in my job now. [EOU] How’s everything on your side? [EOU] too much work? [EOU] Kai [SAYS] yes, I basically never rest these days. [EOU] Michael [SAYS] that’s not good, you need rest to avoid a burnout, which I had just before I went on holiday. [EOU] Kai [SAYS] Probably, I have a conference 8th of Dec, then I'll rest a bit, I hope. [EOU]

[EOU] Melissa [SAYS] No one is saying men should behave like animals. [EOU] Its that kind of thinking that makes men afraid to just be masculine in general though. [EOU] Not all men are pigs.

Stefano [SAYS] Hi, Josie! [EOU] Josie [SAYS] Ciao, Stefano! [EOU] Stefano [SAYS] So, what about Foucault's Pendulum? [EOU] Do you like it? [EOU] Josie [SAYS] It's... [EOU] weird. [EOU] Was it really written by an Italian guy? [EOU] It's so... [EOU] nerdy. [EOU] Stefano [SAYS] Oh well, in a sense Eco was the king of nerds. [EOU] And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. [EOU] :P. [EOU] Josie [SAYS] Yes, I know... [EOU] I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate. [EOU] Stefano [SAYS] The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know. [EOU] Josie [SAYS] And what about Foucault's Pendulum? [EOU] Stefano [SAYS] Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. [EOU] The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel. [EOU] Josie [SAYS] Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s. [EOU] Stefano [SAYS] Really? [EOU] What did he say? [EOU] Josie [SAYS] He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game. [EOU] Stefano [SAYS] What? [EOU] Rotfl! [EOU] Josie [SAYS] That's what Salman said... [EOU] Stefano [SAYS] Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum... [EOU] Josie [SAYS] De gustiBus! [EOU] Stefano [SAYS] I know, it was a typo! [EOU] Josie [SAYS] Disgusting pus! [EOU] Stefano [SAYS] Hahaha. [EOU] Josie [SAYS] Yuk! [EOU] That's so creepy. [EOU] Stefano [SAYS] You're the one who said it! [EOU] Josie [SAYS] I know. [EOU] ;) [EOU]

Bobby [SAYS] U know what annoys me the most? [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] Not being able to watch TV or listen to music without pesky interruptions? [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] That too, but the thing that annoys me the most is pharmaceuticals, medicine and drugs. [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] Y? [EOU] Aren't they good 4 ur health? [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] They may well be, but not for my wallet! [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] What do u mean? [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] I was watching a film last night and suddenly there's a bunch of commercial of different medical products and so on. [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] And what of it? [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] Imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses! [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] What? [EOU] Are u sure? [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] No, I'm not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of. [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] So what? [EOU] There are many illnesses and diseases I've never heard of. [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] So I did some research. [EOU] Turns out such a thing does not exist. [EOU] No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution. [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] I even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it's not an illness. [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] All right, this is quite serious. [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] So I put my mind to it and do u know what I came up with? [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] What? [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] That in this particular case they're selling mints as medical products! [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] Srsly?! [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] Absolutely! [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] How long do u think they've been lying to us? [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] Can't be sure, but probably 4ever. [EOU] Imagine every illness, disease and so on. [EOU] Where do these come from? [EOU] Why do they spread so fast? [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] That is kinda puzzling. [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] Right? [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] So why is no one doing anything about it? [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] Do u know how much the pharmaceutical industry is worth today? [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] No. [EOU] Bobby [SAYS] At least $1.2 bln! [EOU] Mickey [SAYS] Explains a lot. [EOU]
Dave [SAYS] Hey, do you have any notes from statistics? [EOU] Greg [SAYS] Hey man [EOU] I do [EOU] But I doubt they are better than yours.

[EOU] Mark [SAYS] Could be funny! [EOU] Sally [SAYS] Please don't! [EOU] I just got all her spells and stuff! [EOU] Mark [SAYS] I won't, I'm j/k. [EOU] Sally [SAYS] You better be.

[EOU] John [SAYS] exactly, too much money involved [EOU] everybody wants it's resources, they are crucial for the US, for China, for everybody. [EOU] Alice [SAYS] for our smartphones.

[EOU] Tim [SAYS] Hard to say what should be done. [EOU] John [SAYS] Surely the elections were not done properly. [EOU] Tim [SAYS] this for sure [EOU]

Iris [SAYS] <file_other> [EOU] My husband is famous!!! [EOU] Pete [SAYS] Oh come on! [EOU] I've got this 1 interview and it really doesn't make me famous... [EOU] Iris [SAYS] Haha. [EOU] You don't even realize what this "1 inteview" means for my parents. [EOU] They're just like: "We're glad that you found yourself a decent man" [EOU] Pete [SAYS] Hahaha. [EOU] I'm flattered :) I'll be home in 1 hour. [EOU]  [EOU]
Iris [SAYS] Anyone know how to fix this? [EOU] Trying to remove myself from an expense: > This expense involves a person who has left the group, and thus it can no longer be edited. [EOU] If you wish to change this expense, you must first add that person back to your group. [EOU] Ken [SAYS] You got the email address of the person? [EOU] Iris [SAYS] Doesn't say. [EOU] But probably juls? [EOU] Luke [SAYS] Probably have to delete that expense and re-add it. [EOU] Iris [SAYS] I’m gonna try. [EOU] Luke [SAYS] It's the car right? [EOU] Ken [SAYS] yip. [EOU] Iris [SAYS] gracias. [EOU] Ken [SAYS] fixed it - absorbed Juls extra cost so we can remove her from the group again. [EOU] Gerardo [SAYS] We will need to add her towards the car rental price. [EOU] Ken [SAYS] true that - let me know when you are doing that and I'll add her back in. [EOU] Julia [SAYS] Ooops, that’d be me. [EOU] Ken [SAYS] No worries, we got this :) [EOU] Julia [SAYS] let me know how much I owe u so I can wire :) [EOU] Ken [SAYS] I guess by the end of the month – something unpredicted always pops up in the meantime so we have to recalculate again. [EOU] Gerardo [SAYS] Speaking of which, I’m gonna ask the peeps leaving early to stay in the splitwise group until the end of the month. [EOU] Ken [SAYS] Sara, George. [EOU] George [SAYS] We will, my man. [EOU] Gerardo [SAYS] It’s gonna be the $ for gas too [EOU]

Jess [SAYS] Guys, last night I dreamt I was a lion tamer, does it mean I should go to Africa this summer? [EOU] XD. [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] Or maybe you'll meet a handsome zookeeper? [EOU] :D [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] Or you'll get attacked by a stray cat? [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] You've just spoiled all the fun! [EOU] :P. [EOU] Jess [SAYS] Knowing my luck, Charlie might be the closest to the truth. [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] Do you really believe that dreams can mean something? [EOU] Jess [SAYS] No, of course not! [EOU] I was just joking. [EOU] It was such a surreal dream that I had to share it with you ;) [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] Well... [EOU] Jess [SAYS] Do you believe in dreams, Lynn? [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] I'm not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. [EOU] Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it's just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don't you think? [EOU] Jess [SAYS] I guess? [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. [EOU] Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream. [EOU] Jess [SAYS] So you're telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood? [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] Exactly! [EOU] You don't even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage. [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] WOW, it sounds really cool! [EOU]
Charles [SAYS] How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance? [EOU] Karen [SAYS] You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten. [EOU] From what I've heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but I don't think may lead to your death. [EOU] Jack [SAYS] Why are you asking? [EOU] Is there something wrong? [EOU] Charles [SAYS] Hm, I don't know, I feel that I may be allergic or something. [EOU] Monica [SAYS] Do you have any symptoms? [EOU] Check those articles: [EOU] <file_other>, <file_other> [EOU] Karen [SAYS] I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me [EOU] When it comes to intolerance... [EOU] I know it's very hip to be gluten intolerant, but I don't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. [EOU] Unless you have a coeliac disease, I think you're fine. [EOU] Jack [SAYS] My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine. [EOU] Charles [SAYS] I may do it as well. [EOU] I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much. [EOU] Karen [SAYS] But do you feel differently after eating gluten? [EOU] Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. [EOU] Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better. [EOU] Monica [SAYS] I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. [EOU] I stopped eating it and I'm much better now. [EOU] Jack [SAYS] But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this? [EOU] Monica [SAYS] It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. [EOU] I don't know how it works, but it happens. [EOU] Charles [SAYS] I think it's the same with me. [EOU] I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare. [EOU] Karen [SAYS] You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. [EOU] Maybe it has nothing to do with food? [EOU] Charles [SAYS] I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. [EOU] My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet. [EOU] Karen [SAYS] It may be, but I'm not so sure. [EOU] Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm. [EOU] Monica [SAYS] You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat. [EOU] Charles [SAYS] Thanks! [EOU] I'm really worried, because it's getting worse and I have no idea what's happening with me [EOU]
Ulysses [SAYS] Did you see your grades? [EOU] Peter [SAYS] Yes. [EOU] Ulysses [SAYS] I got an A. [EOU] Peter [SAYS] Me too. [EOU] Julia [SAYS] B. [EOU] Martha [SAYS] Where can I check them? [EOU] Julia [SAYS] Online [EOU] On the course page [EOU]
