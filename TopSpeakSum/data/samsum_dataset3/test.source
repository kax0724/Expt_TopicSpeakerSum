Clara [SAYS] Hi, what you up to? [EOU] [EOT] Neela [SAYS] Not much, chilling out. [EOU] [EOT] Clara [SAYS] Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍 [EOU] [EOT] Neela [SAYS] Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? [EOU] Any good? [EOU] [EOT] Clara [SAYS] Well, yes! [EOU] I just said it was, LOL. [EOU] It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence. [EOU] [EOT] Neela [SAYS] Why is it called Dear White People? [EOU] [EOT] Clara [SAYS] That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio. [EOU] [EOT] Neela [SAYS] Yeah, but why is it so good? [EOU] [EOT] Clara [SAYS] Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. [EOU] The characters are strong and likeable too. [EOU] [EOT] Neela [SAYS] I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then? [EOU] [EOT] Clara [SAYS] It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. [EOU] It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand. [EOU] [EOT] Neela [SAYS] How's that? [EOU] [EOT] Clara [SAYS] Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. [EOU] It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that. [EOU] [EOT] Neela [SAYS] Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. [EOU] What else happens? [EOU] [EOT] Clara [SAYS] Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. [EOU] He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies. [EOU] [EOT] Neela [SAYS] Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon! [EOU] [EOT] Clara [SAYS] Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it! [EOU] [EOT] Neela [SAYS] Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People. [EOU] [EOT] Clara [SAYS] Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4! [EOU] [EOT] Neela [SAYS] See ya, love! [EOU] [EOT] Clara [SAYS] Bye! [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] Gosh, thats nearly 4 years ago now, time flies! [EOU] What was the favour, darling? [EOU] [EOT] Beth [SAYS] Oh, it was just that I fancied trying a bit of work experience in the salon, auntie. [EOU] [EOT] Deirdre [SAYS] Well, I am looking for Saturday girls, are you sure about it? [EOU] you could do well in the exams and go on to college or 6th form. [EOU] [EOT] Beth [SAYS] I know, but it's not for me, auntie, I am doing all foundation papers and I'm struggling with those. [EOU] [EOT] Deirdre [SAYS] What about a tutor? [EOU] Kira could help you in the hols. [EOU] [EOT] Beth [SAYS] Maybe, but I'd like to try working. [EOU] I'm 16 soon, I'm old enough. [EOU] [EOT] Deirdre [SAYS] I know. [EOU] Look, pop in tomorrow after school and we'll have a cuppa and a chat. [EOU] [EOT] Beth [SAYS] Yes, thanks auntie. [EOU] I'd really like to try the beauty therapy side. [EOU] [EOT] Deirdre [SAYS] Its not for the squeamish, mind. [EOU] Massage, pedicures, not to mention waxing! [EOU] [EOT] Beth [SAYS] Oh yes, I was chatting to a friend about it yesterday! [EOU] [EOT] Deirdre [SAYS] Maxine manages the beauty side, you can meet her tomorrow and we'll see how it goes. [EOU] [EOT] Beth [SAYS] Yes, I'd really like that. [EOU] [EOT] Deirdre [SAYS] We can try a few hours on a Saturday for a couple of weeks as work experience. [EOU] I'll give you a tenner or so per session to start off for your lunch, coffee and bus fare etc. [EOU] If you like, we'll take it from there. [EOU] [EOT] Beth [SAYS] OK, I like the sound of it! [EOU] See you tomorrow Auntie! [EOU] Love you! [EOU] [EOT] Deirdre [SAYS] Bye, lovely girl! [EOU] Xx [EOU] [EOT]
Gloria [SAYS] This exam is a bit of a lottery in fact [EOU] You can't really get prepared, it's all about experience. [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] But there are some rules and some typical texts right? [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] You can see some texts from previous years [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] Wow that's very useful [EOU] I have never seen this site. [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] Yes it's very good [EOU] Actually it's good to read all the texts because you will see that some phrases repeat very often. [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] How much time do you have for all 4 parts? [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] 4 hours. [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] Is it enough? [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] Well it has to be [EOU] Would be perfect to have 2 more hours... [EOU] But on the other hand it would be really exhausting. [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] 4 hours and no breaks? [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] No breaks :/ So it's really important to be really focused and try to write as fast as you can [EOU] And read it carefully and correct during the last hour. [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] I'm going to read everything from that website, it's great [EOU] [EOT]
Adam [SAYS] Have you talked to May? [EOU] [EOT] Karen [SAYS] Yes, yesterday, why? [EOU] [EOT] Adam [SAYS] I just talked to her and I must admit I worry about her. [EOU] [EOT] Karen [SAYS] Me too, I suggested she should see a specialist, but she wasn't very happy about it. [EOU] [EOT] Adam [SAYS] No wonder... [EOU] [EOT] Karen [SAYS] I know, but I think this is serious. [EOU] She's saying she's depressed, like everyone around, but in her case it may be true. [EOU] [EOT] Adam [SAYS] She was telling me she doesn't feel like doing anything, she's bored all the time, she never feels happy. [EOU] It sounds like a real, typical depression [EOU] She also told me that she has trouble sleeping. [EOU] I asked her to go out for a beer or anything basically, but she doesn't want to leave the flat. [EOU] [EOT] Karen [SAYS] Oh my, it sounds really serious. [EOU] I don't what to tell you. [EOU] [EOT] Adam [SAYS] I was wondering how I can help her. [EOU] [EOT] Karen [SAYS] Honestly I don't know if we can help her, Adam. [EOU] I suggested a specialist because these are very sensitive issues and I'm afraid we may unintentionally make it worse. [EOU] [EOT] Adam [SAYS] Yes, but she doesn't want to see a specialist. [EOU] Basically, she doesn't want to see anyone. [EOU] [EOT] Karen [SAYS] Hm... [EOU] I don't know... [EOU] How about I call someone for advice? [EOU] So we could know what to do. [EOU] [EOT] Adam [SAYS] Sounds rational, do you know anyone you could call? [EOU] Don't mention her name. [EOU] [EOT] Karen [SAYS] Of course I won't!

Jesse [SAYS] I have an idea that'll cheer u up! [EOU] [EOT] Melvin [SAYS] What is it? [EOU] [EOT] Jesse [SAYS] I was thinking about doing something 4 the less fortunate this year. [EOU] [EOT] Lee [SAYS] Gr8 idea! [EOU] Anything in mind? [EOU] [EOT] Maxine [SAYS] So no presents 4 me? [EOU] :( [EOU] [EOT] Jesse [SAYS] U'll get ur presents, no worries ;) [EOU] [EOT] Maxine [SAYS] Phew! [EOU] Was getting a bit worried for a moment ;) [EOU] [EOT] Melvin [SAYS] Bt what do u have in store? [EOU] [EOT] Jesse [SAYS] Well, have u heard about the Refuge? [EOU] [EOT] Lee [SAYS] No. [EOU] What's that? [EOU] [EOT] Melvin [SAYS] That's the Christmas foundation to help women and children? [EOU] [EOT] Maxine [SAYS] I think I've heard of them. [EOU] So what about them? [EOU] [EOT] Jesse [SAYS] That's right! [EOU] They help women and children who escape from abuse. [EOU] And every year they post wish lists of such ppl online and I thought that we could choose one and chip in. [EOU] [EOT] Melvin [SAYS] That's a great idea! [EOU] [EOT] Lee [SAYS] Count me in! [EOU] [EOT] Maxine [SAYS] Me too. [EOU] [EOT] Jesse [SAYS] Have a look at these 3 lists: <file_other> <file_other> <file_other> [EOU] [EOT] Lee [SAYS] I think the second one would be the easiest to arrange. [EOU] [EOT] Maxine [SAYS] Agree. [EOU] [EOT] Melvin [SAYS] What about number 3? [EOU] A bit ambitious, but if we pull together, we'll manage. [EOU] [EOT] Jesse [SAYS] Actually, I'm in for the 3rd one. [EOU] [EOT] Maxine [SAYS] I think the 2nd list would be better. [EOU] The items cos more or less the same and we can easily divide it. [EOU] [EOT] Melvin [SAYS] But if we agree to chip in the same amount of money, we can deal with the 3rd one easily. [EOU] [EOT] Lee [SAYS] Come to think of it, the 3rd one is not that bad. [EOU] A bit of planning and logistics and were good to go. [EOU] [EOT] Jesse [SAYS] So it's settled? [EOU] [EOT] Melvin [SAYS] Yup. [EOU] [EOT] Lee [SAYS] Sure. [EOU] [EOT] Maxine [SAYS] Fine. [EOU] [EOT]

Hannah [SAYS] HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! [EOU] :))) [EOU] [EOT] Brooklyn [SAYS] Same to you! [EOU] Have you made any New Year's resolutions? [EOU] ;> [EOU] [EOT] Hannah [SAYS] A whole list ^^ [EOU] New year, new me :D [EOU] [EOT] Brooklyn [SAYS] Really? [EOU] :D So how you're going to change your life this year? [EOU] [EOT] Hannah [SAYS] First, I'm gonna lose weight and exercise everyday (or at least 3 times a week). [EOU] Second, I want to learn how to cook and start meal prepping [EOU] Finally, I'm gonna find my future husband (or at least start using dating apps):D [EOU] And you? [EOU] Have you set any goals for 2019? [EOU] [EOT] Brooklyn [SAYS] Hmm, interesting :D especially the last point ^^ [EOU] Yeah, just one - not to make any resolutions. [EOU] [EOT] Hannah [SAYS] Whyyyy?? [EOU] [EOT] Brooklyn [SAYS] I just don't believe that a new year means a fresh start. [EOU] Every past year I told myself I would lose weight, quit smoking, start going to the gym etc. [EOU] And I'm still a fatty, who smokes like a chimney and rarely leaves their couch. [EOU] [EOT] Hannah [SAYS] You're a little ray of sunshine, aren't you? [EOU] ;) [EOU] [EOT] Brooklyn [SAYS] :p And you're an undaunted optimist. [EOU] What makes you believe that everything is going to change for the better? [EOU] [EOT] Hannah [SAYS] I don't know, I just like to think that we get numerous second chances to change our lives, to make right what's wrong. [EOU] That's it, I don't have any better explanation. [EOU] [EOT] Brooklyn [SAYS] Well, you haven't convinced me. [EOU] :) Nevertheless good luck with all your resolutions. [EOU] ;) [EOU] [EOT] Hannah [SAYS] Thanks! [EOU] :* [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Richard [SAYS] You haven't gone and got that Abigail up the duff have you? [EOU] [EOT] Trevor [SAYS] That's the long and short of it, Uncle. [EOU] [EOT] Richard [SAYS] Shit. [EOU] How did that happen? [EOU] [EOT] Trevor [SAYS] Well, it's her father's fault, Uncle. [EOU] [EOT] Richard [SAYS] Her father's fault? [EOU] And him a church pastor? [EOU] [EOT] Trevor [SAYS] Yes, Uncle. [EOU] She has sneaked me into the house really quietly and we are in her bedroom doing it. [EOU] [EOT] Richard [SAYS] Fucking hell. [EOU] Do go on. [EOU] [EOT] Trevor [SAYS] And we haven't got any condoms so I am planning to pull out at the last moment. [EOU] [EOT] Richard [SAYS] Unbelieveable: Bloody idiot. [EOU] What then? [EOU] [EOT] Trevor [SAYS] So I am just pulling out and all of a sudden in bursts her father and delivers me such a kick up the arse that I am back in there coming. [EOU] [EOT] Richard [SAYS] So you say it is all his fault, then? [EOU] Incredible. [EOU] [EOT] Trevor [SAYS] Yes. [EOU] [EOT] Richard [SAYS] So maybe we can get him to pay the child support instead of you then, eh? [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Gail [SAYS] Nah. [EOU] That's just how she is. [EOU] The more she posts, the less she does. [EOU] Like she had a phase for animal shelters. [EOU] Remember? [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] She just wouldn't shut up about it. [EOU] She posted every single thing she could find on the subject! [EOU] [EOT] Gail [SAYS] Right. [EOU] And turned out that was everything she did. [EOU] Never visited one. [EOU] Never donated a dime. [EOU] Never did anything. [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] And all the time I thought she was so active and pro-active and charitable. [EOU] She had me fooled ;) [EOU] [EOT] Gail [SAYS] U see? [EOU] Spying on ppl is fun :) [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] Speaking of which, did u spy on me? [EOU] [EOT] Gail [SAYS] No, y would I?

[EOU] [EOT] Gail [SAYS] Besides ur pretty straightforward. [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] What do u mean? [EOU] [EOT] Gail [SAYS] When ur eating, u post food. [EOU] When ur training, u post fitness materials or photos. [EOU] When ur relaxing, u post a bunch of stuff. [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] I know :) that's y ppl like what I do, 'caus I genuine :) [EOU] [EOT] Gail [SAYS] Yeah... [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] What's that supposed to mean?

Hayden [SAYS] Anyway I have 1 month to write my thesis.

[EOU] [EOT] Peter [SAYS] Nah, I don’t have much of weight to lose, just want to improve my health. [EOU] [EOT] Lisa [SAYS] That’s a good thought. [EOU] I was also thinking of working out a bit.

[EOU] [EOT] Peter [SAYS] Another major requirement for good health is sleep. [EOU] On an average one requires at least 7-8 hours of sleep. [EOU] [EOT] Lisa [SAYS] There are a lot of things we can do to stay healthy. [EOU] [EOT] Peter [SAYS] Yes. [EOU] One needs to maintain a regime to stay healthy for a long term. [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Hank [SAYS] I'm not sure if I have to fill out all the fields. [EOU] Most of them don't even apply to Rodney. [EOU] It's strange that they're incorporating such professional tests for little leaguers. [EOU] [EOT] Don [SAYS] Hmm... [EOU] I don't know. [EOU] I'll check it later tonight when I get home. [EOU] Apparently it's supposed to be a database of all the young up-and-coming hockey stars. [EOU] Scouts use that information for future contracts, etc. [EOU] [EOT] Hank [SAYS] OK, but our kids are 10 years old! [EOU] They're not signing any contracts for now :) [EOU] [EOT] Don [SAYS] Well, obviously not, but it's kind of cool that they'll be in a world database of peewee hockey players. [EOU] [EOT] Hank [SAYS] Yeah, I guess. [EOU] So apparently the tests are supposed to last 5-8 pm. [EOU] 3 hours! [EOU] I'll probably wait and work on the computer. [EOU] [EOT] Don [SAYS] Bring a blanket :) It can get mighty cold sitting in a rink for 3 hours. [EOU] [EOT] Hank [SAYS] No shit :) Are you coming. [EOU] [EOT] Don [SAYS] Well, since you're going anyway, maybe you can take my kid :) [EOU] [EOT] Hank [SAYS] Hey, that's not fair! [EOU] [EOT] Don [SAYS] I'll take the kids next time, I promise! [EOU] [EOT] Hank [SAYS] Yeah, yeah, we'll see. [EOU] I'll tell you about the tests when I bring Oscar and Roger back. [EOU] [EOT] Don [SAYS] Ok, thanks again, I owe you. [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Helen [SAYS] I have this wonderful perdiatrician, doctor Tornez, he is great with kids and treats every case individually.

Vincent [SAYS] <file_photo> [EOU] [EOT] Damian [SAYS] What happened to your lamp? [EOU] [EOT] Vincent [SAYS] I broke it xD [EOU] With my bare hand. [EOU] [EOT] Damian [SAYS] You didn't do this just to show off did you? [EOU] [EOT] Vincent [SAYS] Hahaha. [EOU] xD No. [EOU] I was playing with my cat with a ribbon [EOU] And while raising my hand I just hit the lamp and the glass cover broke. [EOU] [EOT] Damian [SAYS] Shit happens.

Nestor [SAYS] I'm thinking of buying a new laptop [EOU] And it seems that now is a perfect time for it as Black Friday is coming. [EOU] [EOT] Olaf [SAYS] Hahaha. [EOU] [EOT] Nestor [SAYS] I haven't said anything funny, what's wrong with you. [EOU] [EOT] Olaf [SAYS] Everything's fine with me, you're just being silly. [EOU] [EOT] Nestor [SAYS] Why, cuz I want to save some money buying what I need when it's cheaper? [EOU] Do you actually know what Blak Friday is about? [EOU] [EOT] Olaf [SAYS] Of course I know [EOU] It's a cunningly contrived sales pitch [EOU] Prices are thought to be reduced but in fact they're the same or even higher... [EOU] [EOT] Nestor [SAYS] You're just repeating a stupid theory some people made up and try to convince others that it's based on facts. [EOU] [EOT] Olaf [SAYS] You're really naive... [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] Click on this link and see for yourself [EOU] This is one of the sites where people upload photos of the same product and its price 2 weeks before Black Friday and during the promotion. [EOU] [EOT] Nestor [SAYS] And how do I know whether it's a reliable source or not? [EOU] [EOT] Olaf [SAYS] Carry out your own investigation [EOU] Go and check prices of the chosen products when the promotion is still on and check them again when the promotion is over [EOU] Simple. [EOU] [EOT] Nestor [SAYS] What if the laptop I want has been really cheaper and I'll miss a perfect deal? [EOU] [EOT] Olaf [SAYS] Then I'll help you [EOU] I know a dude who sells almost new computers at very reasonable prices. [EOU] [EOT] Nestor [SAYS] So ask him to send the offer of what he has in stock to me first [EOU] If he can offer me a good deal, I'm going to the mall and starting investigation tomorrow [EOU] Deal? [EOU] [EOT] Olaf [SAYS] Deal! [EOU] I'll call or text him and ask to contact you. [EOU] I'm sure he'll help you and you'll appreciate my advice :-) [EOU] [EOT] Nestor [SAYS] We'll see about that [EOU] [EOT]
Nancy [SAYS] Yeah, but u can also read the news online ;) [EOU] [EOT] Phil [SAYS] I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. [EOU] Then u can choose what to read and what not. [EOU] [EOT] Nancy [SAYS] Sounds sensible. [EOU] Does it have something 4 fashion? [EOU] [EOT] Phil [SAYS] Probably so. [EOU] Not sure, though. [EOU] [EOT] Nancy [SAYS] How about u, Vic? [EOU] [EOT] Vic [SAYS] I still prefer Facebook. [EOU] Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook. [EOU] [EOT] Phil [SAYS] Well, it's intended in a completely different way. [EOU] [EOT] Vic [SAYS] What do u mean? [EOU] [EOT] Phil [SAYS] IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. [EOU] U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u. [EOU] [EOT] Vic [SAYS] Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. [EOU] And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters. [EOU] [EOT] Phil [SAYS] 280. [EOU] Still, a downside. [EOU] OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook. [EOU] [EOT] Nancy [SAYS] So no one uses 4 example Instagram? [EOU] [EOT] Vic [SAYS] I do. [EOU] [EOT] Phil [SAYS] Not 4 me. [EOU] I don't post that many pictures online. [EOU] [EOT] Nancy [SAYS] But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. [EOU] There are also companies on Instagram. [EOU] [EOT] Phil [SAYS] I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. [EOU] [EOT] Vic [SAYS] That's not all ppl post on Instagram! [EOU] [EOT] Phil [SAYS] So, what else? [EOU] [EOT] Vic [SAYS] Depends on ur interest. [EOU] I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :) [EOU] [EOT] Phil [SAYS] And does this motivate u to train? [EOU] [EOT] Vic [SAYS] No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. [EOU] [EOT] Nancy [SAYS] What do u think about Tumblr? [EOU] [EOT] Phil [SAYS] What? [EOU] [EOT] Vic [SAYS] Heard about it, but never had an account. [EOU] [EOT] Nancy [SAYS] It's a microblogging website. [EOU] U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. [EOU] And ppl can observe u! [EOU] [EOT] Phil [SAYS] Don't have that much time to write a blog. [EOU] [EOT] Vic [SAYS] Me neither. [EOU] [EOT] Phil [SAYS] Nancy, y do u ask these questions? [EOU] ;) [EOU] [EOT] Nancy [SAYS] I have my reasons ;) [EOU] [EOT]
Amanda [SAYS] have you seen the guy with dreads? [EOU] [EOT] Peter [SAYS] yes, so awkward! [EOU] [EOT] Dan [SAYS] hahaha, very, but cool! [EOU] [EOT] Amanda [SAYS] I'm not convinced [EOU] [EOT]

Dima [SAYS] hello! [EOU] [EOT] Nada [SAYS] hey girl, what's up? [EOU] [EOT] Dima [SAYS] I'm in a huge trouble, my laptop is broken and I have to deliver a translation tomorrow @9 😱😱 [EOU] [EOT] Nada [SAYS] fuck what happened?? [EOU] [EOT] Dima [SAYS] the stupid cat spilled coffee on it 😣😣 I'm freaking out! [EOU] you still have your old laptop? [EOU] is it possible to lend it to me please? [EOU] [EOT] Nada [SAYS] no sorry, I've given it to my brother - but you're lucky! [EOU] I've taken these two days off so you can take mine. [EOU] [EOT] Dima [SAYS] ooh man! [EOU] thank you sooo much!!! [EOU] if it weren't for Trados, I wouldn't be panicking :( [EOU] [EOT] Nada [SAYS] no worries, it happened... [EOU] but I always think about this... [EOU] like man, we need some back up laptops! [EOU] [EOT] Dima [SAYS] I know! [EOU] but I always change my mind and spend the money elsewhere lol. [EOU] [EOT] Nada [SAYS] yeah, but it's like our only tool! [EOU] so we need to invest in it. [EOU] [EOT] Dima [SAYS] yup, true ! [EOU] can I come in an hour to pick it up? [EOU] [EOT] Nada [SAYS] yes :) ttyl! [EOU] [EOT]

Melody [SAYS] did you get your computer fixed yet? [EOU] [EOT] Peggy [SAYS] no, im spending a lot of time using the library computers. [EOU] [EOT] Melody [SAYS] do they know whats wrong with it? [EOU] [EOT] Peggy [SAYS] might be something with the circuit board. [EOU] they hope to have an answer tomorrow. [EOU] [EOT] Melody [SAYS] thats pretty serious. [EOU] might be cheaper just to buy a new one. [EOU] [EOT] Peggy [SAYS] thats true. [EOU] well see. [EOU] [EOT] Melody [SAYS] if you need to get a new one, i highly recommend the mac model that i have. [EOU] [EOT] Peggy [SAYS] ok, good to know. [EOU] i'll write if i have any questions. [EOU] [EOT] Melody [SAYS] youre probably due for a new one anyway, no? [EOU] [EOT] Peggy [SAYS] you're right. [EOU] 5 years is a long time to own one. [EOU] [EOT] Melody [SAYS] yes, thats ancient by laptop standards. [EOU] [EOT] Peggy [SAYS] ok. [EOU] i might just not bother getting it repaired after all. [EOU] [EOT] Melody [SAYS] sounds like a good idea [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] Do we need a 5* hotel? [EOU] MAybe let's choose one of the cheaper options from a tour operator? [EOU] [EOT] Mark [SAYS] Actually, not a bad idea.

Stanley [SAYS] I can’t believe in her… [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] What is it? [EOU] And who? [EOU] [EOT] Stanley [SAYS] Del, she’s behaving kind of… stupid. [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] Meaning? [EOU] [EOT] Stanley [SAYS] I told her I can’t go for this weekend with her because of work. [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] And? [EOU] How did she react? [EOU] [EOT] Stanley [SAYS] She was angry and wouldn’t listen to me. [EOU] She accused me of having an affair o.O. [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] You’ve been together for like 4 moths and she’s already doing sth like that??? [EOU] [EOT] Stanley [SAYS] I know, it’s crazy. [EOU] I starting to give up. [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] So what, that’s it? [EOU] [EOT] Stanley [SAYS] No, I’ll talk to her when she’s back, I’ll tell her it can’t be like this, see what will she say. [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] Sorry to say that, I don’t think you’ll bring any good news xD. [EOU] [EOT] Stanley [SAYS] Actually, me too. [EOU] But at least I’ll try. [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] Well, I’m sorry. [EOU] We need to take care of the Lidem project right now. [EOU] [EOT] Stanley [SAYS] Yes I’m finishing the analysis for the pervious one, but it should be done tonight, so I can start working on it today. [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] The problem is I don’t what you should do ;p. [EOU] [EOT] Stanley [SAYS] whaaat. [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] The analysis of tasks is not done yet, Alison disappeared from all the media and won’t answer her phone. [EOU] [EOT] Stanley [SAYS] Great.

Kimberly [SAYS] Hi Laura :) [EOU] [EOT] Laura [SAYS] Hey Kim :) [EOU] [EOT] Kimberly [SAYS] Do u remember if I left the cafe yesterday with my umbrella? [EOU] [EOT] Laura [SAYS] I'm not sure... [EOU] I remember you arriving with it. [EOU] It was a pinkish-blue one, right? [EOU] [EOT] Kimberly [SAYS] Yes, with a flower motive. [EOU] I got it as a present from my Mom a few years back. [EOU] It's not worth anything, but it's about the sentimental value. [EOU] [EOT] Laura [SAYS] I understand, maybe try calling the cafe? [EOU] Maybe a customer found it or a waiter? [EOU] Here's the number: 613-785-4329. [EOU] [EOT] Kimberly [SAYS] Thanks! [EOU] It's worth a try :)  [EOU] [EOT]
Catherine [SAYS] Hi Jake, last week I applied for an accounting position @ Pandora. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] Hey Cathy! [EOU] Really? [EOU] That's great! [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] R u still working there? [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] I sure am. [EOU] It's already been 5 yrs. [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] Time flies. [EOU] So I take it ur satisfied? [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] I am, I rarely think about changing companies. [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] Does the company offer possibilities of personal development & promotion? [EOU] I mean is there a clear career path? [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] Yup, that's the main pro of this place & the benefits. [EOU] I was promoted twice during these 5 yrs & the salary increase with each promotion is quite significant. [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] That's good to hear. [EOU] Most companies 2day are implementing cost saving policies & the employees are the ones who suffer. [EOU] I mean at my current workplace u can only count on inflation salary increases. [EOU] So u barely see the difference on ur paycheck. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] That's what I hear from most of my friends. [EOU] It's a tough time 4 employees on the market nowadays. [EOU] 4 now our company is still dynamically expanding. [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] And how about the benefits u mentioned? [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] The company partially finances language & accounting courses. [EOU] There's also a yearly bonus that depends on your achievements and private healthcare. [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] That sounds like a dream :D Your HR dept. [EOU] gave me a call yesterday and invited me to an interview on Monday. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] That's great! [EOU] I'll keep my fingers crossed :) [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] Thanks Jake :) Is there anything I should prepare/review before the interview? [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] Well I think it would be beneficial to know some facts about the company. [EOU] You can find them on the official website, in the "about us" section: <file_other> [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] OK, I'll definitely take a look. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] And they may ask u some Qs about accounting principles, the basics. [EOU] But I mean that won't be a problem 4 u. [EOU] I remember u graduated with honours from uni. [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] That's true. [EOU] :) I'm a bit nervous though. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] There's no need to be. [EOU] Give me a call after the interview. [EOU] Good luck! [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] Thanks. [EOU] TTYS! [EOU] [EOT]

Clint [SAYS] I'm curious. [EOU] How's the waste management working out over there? [EOU] [EOT] Ronnie [SAYS] It actually works very well. [EOU] We use three different bins: compost, recycle and trash. [EOU] Compost anything organic from yard waste to food scraps. [EOU] Recycle for paper, bottles, cardboard, plastic, metals. [EOU] And trash everything else. [EOU] Why do you ask? [EOU] [EOT] Clint [SAYS] Sheer curiosity. [EOU] What about general awareness? [EOU] Plastic bags, etc.? [EOU] [EOT] Ronnie [SAYS] Very high. [EOU] No more single use plastic bags in grocery stores. [EOU] No more straws in restaurants. [EOU] [EOT] Clint [SAYS] Yeah, I read yours was one of the cities that banned them. [EOU] I wonder when that will get here. [EOU] [EOT] Ronnie [SAYS] Never... [EOU] [EOT] Clint: [SAYS] What do you mean? [EOU] [EOT] Ronnie [SAYS] I highly doubt that type of environmental awareness will happen there. [EOU] People there live in a different world when it comes to that. [EOU] [EOT] Clint [SAYS] People don't have to have any awareness, tbh. [EOU] It's above them. [EOU] If there were such decisions made they would follow. [EOU] [EOT] Ronnie [SAYS] That is true. [EOU] But at the state government level I don't think there is that awareness either. [EOU] But hopefully I am proven wrong! [EOU] [EOT] Clint [SAYS] Really bizarre. [EOU] I noticed it's struggling here. [EOU] On the other hand, it's money. [EOU] [EOT] Ronnie [SAYS] Money in the sense of? [EOU] [EOT] Clint [SAYS] Reducing waste=lower utilization costs. [EOU] Do they sort through everything further down? [EOU] [EOT] Ronnie [SAYS] Yes here they do. [EOU] [EOT] Clint [SAYS] It seems to be the same way here. [EOU] Dry recyclables, food and general, compost  [EOU] [EOT]

Noah [SAYS] Hi there! [EOU] The quince we talked about the other day... [EOU] Are you still interested? [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you. [EOU] [EOT] Noah [SAYS] Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. [EOU] They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time. [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] That's very very kind of him! [EOU] He's really a darling. [EOU] We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. [EOU] How long will they keep? [EOU] Is it windfall? [EOU] [EOT] Noah [SAYS] Both really but they all look very healthy. [EOU] No bruises afa one can see. [EOU] Or only odd small ones. [EOU] They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. [EOU] The weather's cool. [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] It would be a shame if they rotted. [EOU] I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap. [EOU] [EOT] Noah [SAYS] OK. [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. [EOU] Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince? [EOU] [EOT] Noah [SAYS] Absolutely! [EOU] In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. [EOU] Of course it would be great to see your twins again. [EOU] Haven't seen them for ages! [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony. [EOU] [EOT] Noah [SAYS] Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much. [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] I don't blame them! [EOU] We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. [EOU] Everything's absolutely fine. [EOU] You don't have William at home all that often either, do you? [EOU] [EOT] Noah [SAYS] He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of "family care" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. [EOU] They have a strict regime at the academy. [EOU] But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. [EOU] What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own. [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] The fate of most military I guess. [EOU] Hugely unfair I'd say. [EOU] Like being married to your regiment! [EOU] [EOT] Noah [SAYS] That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! [EOU] I never hear a girl's name! [EOU] And when I ask, he gets brusque. [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] Oh dear! [EOU] What could it mean? [EOU] [EOT] Noah [SAYS] No, not what you think! [EOU] We know from Capt. [EOU] Broomsberg about their common escapades. [EOU] Plenty of women but only that sort of women. [EOU] No strings. [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] I never even imagined he might be gay! [EOU] Surely not. [EOU] But there must be sth else. [EOU] [EOT] Noah [SAYS] We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. [EOU] Nothing else counts for him. [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] He's always been very strong-willed. [EOU] And he knows what he wants. [EOU] Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all. [EOU] [EOT] Noah [SAYS] You're probably right. [EOU] But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me. [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] They'll come, don't you worry! [EOU] Look the twins will contact you about the quince. [EOU] Alright? [EOU] [EOT] Noah [SAYS] Sure. [EOU] Thank you Sophie for a nice chat! [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] Thank you for the quince! [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Ben [SAYS] you know very well that I'm not fond of such visits [EOU] they stress me out. [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] Come on, even you can do it from time to time. [EOU] [EOT] Ben [SAYS] maybe I can but I don't want to [EOU] it will end the same way as usual [EOU] with me being pissed at everyone. [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] The boys want to see you. [EOU] [EOT] Ben [SAYS] I can visit you and play with them some other day [EOU] I don't have to drive to another city to do it. [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] You know that he'll be disappointed? [EOU] [EOT] Ben [SAYS] uncle Steve? [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] Yes. [EOU] [EOT] Ben [SAYS] I don't think so, we don't have anything in common [EOU] all he ever does is bothering me with stupid questions about my private life. [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] Maybe that's his way of showing that he cares about you. [EOU] [EOT] Ben [SAYS] yes... [EOU] sure... [EOU] sometimes I wonder if you're thinking about what you type :P. [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] Depends on the day [EOU] Today I'm tired so I can't guarantee it. [EOU] [EOT] Ben [SAYS] you should rest then [EOU] instead of asking me to do stuff I don't like. [EOU] [EOT] Catherine [SAYS] Alright, don't worry, I'll stop [EOU] But still the part about the boys missing you was true [EOU] So come and visit them when you'll have the chance.

Henry [SAYS] Do you know what happened to cafe Kohaku? [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] The one near Covent Garden? [EOU] [EOT] Henry [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] I wanted to reserve a table, but I can't find them anywhere. [EOU] Their Facebook page disappeared. [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] I'm afraid they're closed :( [EOU] [EOT] Henry [SAYS] For good?! [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] Afraid so. [EOU] I've been there last week and wanted to take my cousin there, but the place's empty [EOU] Probably the rent was too high. [EOU] [EOT] Henry [SAYS] Oh no, I loved that place. [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] Me too. [EOU] I checked online for the owners and contacted them, but they haven't replied yet. [EOU] I hope they will reopen somewhere else. [EOU] [EOT] Henry [SAYS] Unless they do it far away, the location was perfect. [EOU] It was a real gem in this touristy district. [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] I know, I know... [EOU] We went the Lilly's in the end, my cousin and I, but it's not the same. [EOU] [EOT] Henry [SAYS] Eh, that's a pity then, I was so looking forward to their brownie [EOU] How was the Lilly's? [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] It's all right, it's a different vibe though. [EOU] I think you should go to the Japan Centre for the same. [EOU] [EOT] Henry [SAYS] Uhm, don't think so. [EOU] It's always awfully crowded and there are more tourists than normal people like us [EOU] [EOT]
Jake [SAYS] What are your plans for the day? [EOU] [EOT] Olivia [SAYS] I haven't really got anything planned. [EOU] There are some things I should do which I haven't looked at for a while. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] Like what? [EOU] [EOT] Olivia [SAYS] I ought to do my accounts. [EOU] At least get all the incoming and outgoing invoices sorted by months. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] Tax filing is a long way off. [EOU] [EOT] Olivia [SAYS] I know, but doing it all at the last minute is a dreadful headache. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] Anything else? [EOU] [EOT] Olivia [SAYS] I also have a few videos I need to upload to YouTube. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] Already ready or you still need to do post-production? [EOU] [EOT] Olivia [SAYS] I don't really do much by way of post-production. [EOU] I'm not exactly Steven Spielberg. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] I do, but I dont always have time to do much. [EOU] [EOT] Olivia [SAYS] If I put in any music I always get a copyright strike and someone else is taking the ad revenue. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] And some of those claims are purely speculative. [EOU] One time I put on one of my own pieces and it was challenged by Sony Music. [EOU] [EOT] Olivia [SAYS] No way! [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] It's true. [EOU] On the form you fill in to counter the claim I said if Sony want to make me one of their signed artists, that's fine.

Emily [SAYS] Oh Linda...Something horrible has happened. [EOU] I'm so sorry. [EOU] I have broken one of your green tea cups. [EOU] Just looked away and brushed it off the table with my skirt. [EOU] SORRY! [EOU] [EOT] Linda [SAYS] No worries babe! [EOU] It's nothing. [EOU] Really. [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] I'm feeling so bad about it. [EOU] So clumsy of me. [EOU] [EOT] Linda [SAYS] Look. [EOU] I never really liked the set, so one cup makes no difference. [EOU] I hardly use it anyway. [EOU] How come it was on the table BTW? [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] I was cleaning the cupboards in the dining room. [EOU] [EOT] Linda [SAYS] You did what? [EOU] Whatever for? [EOU] The crockery there is more for decoration. [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] Exactly. [EOU] I thought they're so pretty, especially the green ones, and then noticed how dusty they are. [EOU] So I thought I'd be a helpful guest and wash them. [EOU] I did. [EOU] And then I made myself a cuppa in the green one. [EOU] And it happened. [EOU] [EOT] Linda [SAYS] Ya golden! [EOU] Really! [EOU] Look, calm down. [EOU] You are a fantastic guest. [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] Ya. [EOU] Smashing. [EOU] As we say in GB. [EOU] [EOT] Linda [SAYS] You know what? [EOU] Take out the whole green set. [EOU] If you like it so much - it is yours. [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] But Linda! [EOU] I'm speechless. [EOU] [EOT] Linda [SAYS] Precious! [EOU] See you in the evening! [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] CU [EOU] And THANK YOU [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Mia [SAYS] ok. [EOU] [EOT] James [SAYS] Are you mad at me?

Mariana [SAYS] Hi, just a quick question. [EOU] Do you know if the readings for the next session of Stephen’s seminar are in the print shop? [EOU] [EOT] Rita [SAYS] No idea, sorry. [EOU] [EOT] Chae-yeong [SAYS] The only thing I know is that they were not yet there on Monday. [EOU] [EOT] Arthur [SAYS] Yer, I’ve made the mistake of going on Monday as well and I can confirm the texts were not there and the staff was as rude as always.

Ost [SAYS] I bought a garage place in the garage. [EOU] [EOT] Vesna [SAYS] Cool. [EOU] [EOT] Ost [SAYS] I got it cheap. [EOU] It's my intention to rent it out and do the restitution of my money. [EOU] [EOT] Vesna [SAYS] Well doneeeee!. [EOU] [EOT] Ost [SAYS] There is a big crowd in parking, so the prices for finding garage places are favorable, in this area. [EOU] [EOT] Vesna [SAYS] Really!. [EOU] [EOT] Ost [SAYS] Return on investment is much higher than if I give money under term savings in the Bank. [EOU] [EOT] Vesna [SAYS] You make sense for money. [EOU] [EOT] Ost [SAYS] The interest rates are very small, almost close to zero, "only they do not ask you to pay them, for holding money in the Bank". [EOU] [EOT] Vesna [SAYS] O yes. [EOU] [EOT] Ost [SAYS] Prices of garage places, in Belgrade, will only grow. [EOU] [EOT] Vesna [SAYS] Really!. [EOU] [EOT] Ost [SAYS] Yes, there are more and more vehicles in the city center, as the number of vehicles per family is growing. [EOU] It used to be about one vehicle per family, and now it's approaching an average of two vehicles. [EOU] [EOT] Vesna [SAYS] Yes.. [EOU] [EOT] Ost [SAYS] And there will not be new parking space. [EOU] [EOT]
Julia [SAYS] Where are you? [EOU] [EOT] Hania [SAYS] That's a good question, haha. [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] Did you stop in Zawiercie already? [EOU] [EOT] Hania [SAYS] No idea...

[EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] Sounds like a plan :) pizza or burgers? [EOU] [EOT] Hania [SAYS] Pizza always :D [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] OK! [EOU] And I will pick you up from the platform, let me know when you pass Żyrardów. [EOU] [EOT] Hania [SAYS] Ok, see you soon! [EOU] :* [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] See you :)) [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Joseph [SAYS] Had three job interviews in two days. [EOU] [EOT] Albert [SAYS] Ouch! [EOU] So... [EOU] any impressions? [EOU] [EOT] Joseph [SAYS] I think the first two were more than ok, they seemed really satisfied with my résumé, heh, guess I'll have to choose one. [EOU] [EOT] Albert [SAYS] Were both interviews for jobs at hotels? [EOU] [EOT] Joseph [SAYS] Yeah, I guess I'm gonna be a concierge until the day I die. [EOU] [EOT] Albert [SAYS] O la la! [EOU] A concierge! [EOU] With his résumé! [EOU] [EOT] Joseph [SAYS] What's so funny about it? [EOU] [EOT] Albert [SAYS] It reminded me of that Simpsons episode, you know... [EOU] "the GARAGE?!

Brett [SAYS] So what do u do there? [EOU] Drive a tank all the time? [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] Yes and no. [EOU] U've got players from around the world and they have their tank squadrons and u battle them. [EOU] Can be a lot of fun! [EOU] [EOT] Andrew [SAYS] So what happens if someone is on a higher level than u? [EOU] They basically destroy u! [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] That's not a problem. [EOU] The game doesn't allow higher ranked players o interact with players out of their range. [EOU] [EOT] Brett [SAYS] What do u mean? [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] If ur on lvl 5, a player on lvl 30 can't attack u. [EOU] [EOT] Andrew [SAYS] Sensible. [EOU] Unlike WoW. [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] So what's WoW like? [EOU] [EOT] Andrew [SAYS] Imagine having a character u rly like and u give it a lot of ur attention and get experience point, level up and so on. [EOU] Someone who's played the game for like a year comes and kills u instantly. [EOU] [EOT] Brett [SAYS] Not cool. [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] Y would they allow such a thing? [EOU] [EOT] Andrew [SAYS] Well, open world, u can team up with anyone, do quests together, arrange fighting tactics and so on. [EOU] [EOT] Brett [SAYS] Actually, my cousin met his wife there :) [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] Rly? [EOU] [EOT] Brett [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] They were playing together for some time, talking and at some point he invited her to a date. [EOU] Turned out they lived very close to each other ;) [EOU] [EOT] Andrew [SAYS] That's gr8! [EOU] And how are they getting along now? [EOU] [EOT] Brett [SAYS] Most fights are about who gets 2 play at a given moment ;) [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] Lol. [EOU] [EOT] Andrew [SAYS] Well my favourite genre is RPGs :) [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] Can u name a title, except WoW? [EOU] [EOT] Andrew [SAYS] I can name a dozen, but one of my personal faves is the Final Fantasy series :) [EOU] [EOT] Brett [SAYS] What's this one about? [EOU] [EOT] Andrew [SAYS] Don't tell me u haven't heard about the greatest RPG series of all times? [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] Well, I haven't. [EOU] [EOT] Andrew [SAYS] I think I'll have to look for new friends... [EOU] So embarrassing. [EOU] [EOT] Brett [SAYS] C'mon! [EOU] Tell us! [EOU] [EOT] Andrew [SAYS] Fine... [EOU] Usually u play a group of friends that have to resolve some kind of crisis. [EOU] In the last part u play a prince whose kingdom has been destroyed and u try to well get revenge. [EOU] [EOT] Brett [SAYS] Sounds boring. [EOU] [EOT] Andrew [SAYS] Believe me, it's not! [EOU] [EOT]
Rael [SAYS] Gosh, I fucking hate my job! [EOU] [EOT] Zach [SAYS] Oops! [EOU] Someone is in a mood... [EOU] [EOT] Rael [SAYS] I'm serious, I'm done. [EOU] Those people are fucked up. [EOU] I cannot stand it anymore. [EOU] [EOT] Zach [SAYS] Is it that bad? [EOU] [EOT] Rael [SAYS] Even worse... [EOU] [EOT] Zach [SAYS] What this time? [EOU] [EOT] Rael [SAYS] I don't even have time to eat my fucking lunch. [EOU] It's not normal. [EOU] [EOT] Zach [SAYS] Did you talk to your manager? [EOU] [EOT] Rael [SAYS] Yeah, this retard doesn't get that we're humans not robots. [EOU] I hate him. [EOU] [EOT] Zach [SAYS] You're gonna quit? [EOU] [EOT] Rael [SAYS] It's not that easy, I gotta find something. [EOU] I don't want to leave without first finding a new job. [EOU] [EOT] Zach [SAYS] I see. [EOU] Did you think about IT? [EOU] [EOT] Rael [SAYS] No, why? [EOU] [EOT] Zach [SAYS] Girl, it's the best place to work in! [EOU] A lot of my friends started as software testers and they are really satisfied. [EOU] Good money and no rat race. [EOU] [EOT] Rael [SAYS] Zach, are you crazy? [EOU] I don't have technical studies. [EOU] [EOT] Zach [SAYS] You don't have to. [EOU] If you have good analytical skills all you need is some online course - Udemy or something. [EOU] People change their career after years of employment in totally different business.

Kate [SAYS] I just had a fight with Chris :/ [EOU] [EOT] Mary [SAYS] Oh no, not again. [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] It's not me who started it. [EOU] I don't know why he says certain stuff, it seems like he's doing it on purpose. [EOU] [EOT] Mary [SAYS] What was it this time? [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] Same thing, as always. [EOU] Really, he knows what I think and I know what he thinks so I don't bring up certain things. [EOU] I don't want to argue, but if it keeps happening, I don't see the point of talking to him [EOU] I'm angry every single time I talk with him. [EOU] [EOT] Mary [SAYS] Eh, I don't get why he keeps doing it. [EOU] What did he say? [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. [EOU] He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it. [EOU] [EOT] Mary [SAYS] oh god. [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] right?! [EOU] I don't know why I'm still talking with him. [EOU] I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck. [EOU] [EOT] Mary [SAYS] What did you tell him? [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] What I usually tell him. [EOU] He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, I sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything. [EOU] [EOT] Mary [SAYS] I'm afraid Chris may be too pig-headed for that. [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] Pfff I bet he didn't even read anything. [EOU] He's just watching the nationalists, Trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once. [EOU] [EOT] Mary [SAYS] I know, to be honest I kind of avoid these subjects when I'm talking with him. [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] Well, I try to as well, but as you can see he can't stop himself [EOU] I know he's our friend and we go out often, but I'm not sure I can do it any more, I don't want be friends with someone who thinks that Mexican children are worse and that they should be kept away from the US. [EOU] [EOT] Mary [SAYS] Oh my god he said that? [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] Yes :/ [EOU] [EOT] Mary [SAYS] Jesus, I knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? [EOU] That's a bit too much. [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] You're telling me this. [EOU] I think we should reconsider this let's say friendship, because if every conversation will lead to something like this, I'm not interested in staying in touch with him. [EOU] [EOT] Mary [SAYS] No wonder [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] There is nothing special in it, but I hope you'll think twice next time you decide to send a traditional letter.

[EOU] [EOT] Truman [SAYS] And what about the beaten guy? [EOU] [EOT] Rodney [SAYS] He's in the hospital, but it seems like he'll be fine. [EOU] [EOT] Ross [SAYS] You think it was a student? [EOU] [EOT] Rodney [SAYS] Who knows what those jocks are capable of. [EOU] [EOT] Ross [SAYS] They could do it just for fun. [EOU] [EOT] Truman [SAYS] On the other hand its easy to get on campus without being detected. [EOU] [EOT] Ross [SAYS] There are cameras. [EOU] [EOT] Truman [SAYS] If your masked it don't matter. [EOU] You know how those security guards are. [EOU] [EOT] Rodney [SAYS] They don't give a fuck. [EOU] [EOT] Ross [SAYS] True that. [EOU] [EOT] Truman [SAYS] Hope they catch the guy soon [EOU] [EOT]
Nathan [SAYS] Hey Honey, what are our plans for tomorrow then? [EOU] [EOT] Deborah [SAYS] So I've been thinking that we should pack everything today, we won't have time tomorrow. [EOU] [EOT] Nathan [SAYS] Totally true, I started packing my stuff in the bedroom, I also told the girls to start packing too. [EOU] [EOT] Deborah [SAYS] If Sofie wants to take the unicorn we won't have much space in the car XD. [EOU] [EOT] Nathan [SAYS] No, I explained to her that he'll be fine without her these few days, I hope it worked :D [EOU] [EOT] Deborah [SAYS] We need to take boots and those warm jackets for the girls, my parents promised them to take them on a trip to the forest. [EOU] [EOT] Nathan [SAYS] I remember, Lucy was really excited about that. [EOU] Are we taking the bicycles? [EOU] [EOT] Deborah [SAYS] Yeah, don't you think we could use some alone time while the rest of the family is hiking? [EOU] XD. [EOU] [EOT] Nathan [SAYS] Now you're talking! [EOU] We could have a ride to this beautiful cliff where we were last year! [EOU] [EOT] Deborah [SAYS] Why not, it's a wonderful idea! [EOU] :* [EOU] [EOT] Nathan [SAYS] So tomorrow I'm seeing the dentist after work, you go to pick up the girls from school… [EOU] [EOT] Deborah [SAYS] Yeah, then we meet at home, have a quick bite (you probably won't, haha!) [EOU] [EOT] Nathan [SAYS] Thanks Honey, so nice of you to remind me of this! [EOU] After the quick bite you girls have, we are off! [EOU] [EOT] Deborah [SAYS] Damn, I forgot to buy this syrup for travel sickness. [EOU] Will you have time today to do it? [EOU] [EOT] Nathan [SAYS] Yes, it's feasible :) I'll do it on my way from work. [EOU] [EOT] Deborah [SAYS] Wonderful! [EOU] So see you in the evening then? [EOU] [EOT] Nathan [SAYS] I should be home around 6, if nothing happens. [EOU] [EOT] Deborah [SAYS] Dinner will be waiting for you in the oven, bye :* [EOU] [EOT]
Casper [SAYS] Is any of you nobel fellows going for tomorrow's classes with Mr Linda? [EOU] [EOT] Alexander [SAYS] Hmm... [EOU] To be or not to be, that is the question! [EOU] But remembering the last lecture with Linda, my answer is like moving towards NO. [EOU] [EOT] Igor [SAYS] Amen to that, Alex! [EOU] Last time I came so self-motivated and full of energy that I thought I could even dominate the lecture [EOU] I sat in the second row, concentrated, even took some notes and asked two questions [EOU] After few minutes Lewis poked me and told to stop snoring... [EOU] [EOT] Casper [SAYS] Ahahahaha [EOU] True, I saw that! [EOU] [EOT] Alexander [SAYS] I think it's not that the subjects themselves are boring, it must be his voice [EOU] I mean it's so monotonous and hypnotic. [EOU] Kind of... [EOU] lulling you to sleep. [EOU] [EOT] Igor [SAYS] Yeah, that guy is like David Copperfield among lecturers. [EOU] [EOT] Alexander [SAYS] Haha David Copperfield :D [EOU] Let's call him like that from now on! [EOU] He even looks like the magician a little :D [EOU] [EOT] Casper [SAYS] That's a fancy nickname, I like it [EOU] But if I wanted to see a magician, I'd rather go to the circus. [EOU] [EOT] Igor [SAYS] So... [EOU] Judging from the overall tone of our discussion I feel that the decision's been already made [EOU] Am I right, gentlemen? [EOU] [EOT] Casper [SAYS] Actually your opinions, my noble fellows, have conirmed my conviction that going there and wasting time doesn't make sense. [EOU] [EOT] Alexander [SAYS] Not a bit! [EOU] And learning from Igor's last experience I think we should go somewhere else instead [EOU] I don't want to end up snoring and getting embarrassed :D [EOU] [EOT] Casper [SAYS] Great, so we've reached an unanimous decision. [EOU] [EOT] Igor [SAYS] So where are we going instead? [EOU] [EOT] Casper [SAYS] Let's meet near the university and we'll work something out. [EOU] [EOT] Igor [SAYS] Agreed. [EOU] [EOT] Alexander [SAYS] All right! [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Marsha [SAYS] so as we decided last time, we will spend a week just on the beach [EOU] we all wanted some calm, nice place, right? [EOU] [EOT] Gavin [SAYS] yes!!! [EOU] [EOT] Marsha [SAYS] John found this little hotel in Nosy Be [EOU] <file_photo> [EOU] and their website: <file_other> [EOU] it's quite basic the website, but it may actually be a good sign. [EOU] [EOT] Gavin [SAYS] I love it! [EOU] [EOT] Cynthia [SAYS] it seems just perfect. [EOU] [EOT] Marsha [SAYS] I know [EOU] it's more expensive than hotels on the mainland [EOU] but it seems to be the most beautiful place in Madagascar. [EOU] [EOT] Mohammad [SAYS] so let's go there, it's still cheaper than Italy for example. [EOU] [EOT] Marsha [SAYS] exactly! [EOU] [EOT]
Adelina [SAYS] Hi handsome. [EOU] Where you you come from? [EOU] [EOT] Cyprien [SAYS] What do you mean? [EOU] [EOT] Adelina [SAYS] What do you mean, "what do you mean"? [EOU] It's a simple question, where do you come from? [EOU] [EOT] Cyprien [SAYS] Well I was born in Jarrow, live in London now, so you could say I came from either of those places [EOU] I was educated in Loughborouogh, so in a sense I came from there. [EOU] [EOT] Adelina [SAYS] OK. [EOU] [EOT] Cyprien [SAYS] In another sense I come from my mother's vagina, but I dare say everyone can say that. [EOU] [EOT] Adelina [SAYS] Are you all right? [EOU] [EOT] Cyprien [SAYS] IN another sense I come from the atoms in the air that I breath or the food I eat, which comes to me from many places, so all I can say is "I come from Planet Earth". [EOU] [EOT] Adelina [SAYS] OK, bye. [EOU] If you're gonna be a dick... [EOU] [EOT] Cyprien [SAYS] Wait, what you got against earthlings? [EOU] [EOT]
Joanna [SAYS] I need to get the coffie stains out of my dress [EOU] Do you know any effective methods? [EOU] [EOT] Ethel [SAYS] What color is this dress? [EOU] [EOT] Joanna [SAYS] It's ecru and the fabric is very soft. [EOU] [EOT] Ethel [SAYS] Well, in such a case I wouldn't recommend fixing it by yourself because you can ruin the dress... [EOU] Better leave it at the dry-cleaner's. [EOU] [EOT] Joanna [SAYS] You might be right, just hope it won't cost me an arm and a leg... [EOU] [EOT] Ethel [SAYS] There's a cheap one at Jagiellonska 3, they cleaned up all the stains from my favourite dress :) [EOU] [EOT] Joanna [SAYS] Alright then, I'll give it a try, thanks Ethel!

Enrique [SAYS] Thanks for sharing your collection with the class. [EOU] They loved it! [EOU] [EOT] Farrah [SAYS] No problem! [EOU] It was my pleasure! [EOU] [EOT] Enrique [SAYS] Not everyday you get to see some of those up close and personal like that. [EOU] We were wowed! [EOU] [EOT] Farrah [SAYS] Oh, gee, that's so nice! [EOU] [EOT] Enrique [SAYS] You have a great collection, you should be proud! [EOU] [EOT] Farrah [SAYS] I am, but not everyone appreciates it. [EOU] [EOT] Enrique [SAYS] Fossils are a unique thing to collect, that's for sure. [EOU] [EOT] Farrah [SAYS] If you leave them sitting around, they just become dust magnets! [EOU] [EOT] Enrique [SAYS] So it's good to share them. [EOU] [EOT] Farrah [SAYS] Especially with little kids, they get so amazed! [EOU] It was a fun day. [EOU] [EOT] Enrique [SAYS] It was for us as well! [EOU] Will you come back again? [EOU] [EOT] Farrah [SAYS] Of course! [EOU] Any time! [EOU] [EOT] Enrique [SAYS] I was thinking that our 4th grade students would like to check them out as well. [EOU] Can I give your name and number to that teacher? [EOU] [EOT] Farrah [SAYS] Sure thing. [EOU] [EOT] Enrique [SAYS] I'm not sure how it fits into the lesson plan, so they may not get in touch until next semester. [EOU] [EOT] Farrah [SAYS] Fair enough. [EOU] No problem, I understand. [EOU] [EOT] Enrique [SAYS] Thanks again! [EOU] It was really interesting! [EOU] [EOT] Farrah [SAYS] Of course! [EOU] Any time, and now I have a better idea of other ones to bring next time. [EOU] [EOT] Enrique [SAYS] That would be great. [EOU] [EOT] Farrah [SAYS] Some of the questions really made me wish I had brought my whole collection, but that just isn't practical. [EOU] [EOT] Enrique [SAYS] Oh, I understand. [EOU] I'm sure you'll do fine next time with whatever you bring. [EOU] [EOT] Farrah [SAYS] Thanks! [EOU] [EOT] Enrique [SAYS] Our pleasure! [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Amber [SAYS] But he didn't accept it. [EOU] [EOT] Erin [SAYS] Why not?! [EOU] [EOT] Amber [SAYS] B/c they only offered him the job after a month & during that time he started searching for a new one. [EOU] He got a better offer from a different IT company in London. [EOU] [EOT] Erin [SAYS] Well good for him! [EOU] Since they weren't able to appreciate his work and they didn't offer him something right away. [EOU] [EOT] Amber [SAYS] Exactly, but you know what this means for me? [EOU] [EOT] Erin [SAYS] You're going to have to search for a new flat... [EOU] [EOT] Amber [SAYS] Yup, we had an agreement that I would be renting their place until they returned from Germany. [EOU] But you know, they planned to be there for at least 5 yrs. [EOU] [EOT] Erin [SAYS] I can imagine that Annie isn't happy with this turn of events. [EOU] [EOT] Amber [SAYS] She's pretty pissed off. [EOU] I mean the plan was to save up for a house and only then come back to London. [EOU] She had already enrolled in German classes & they were starting to feel at home there. [EOU] [EOT] Erin [SAYS] That's too bad. [EOU] Sometimes life turns out to be unpredictable. [EOU] If you need somewhere to stay for a while, you can always stay at my place. [EOU] [EOT] Amber [SAYS] Thanks Erin! [EOU] Annie already told me not to worry, that I can stay with them until I don't find something new. [EOU] But I've already started searching. [EOU] [EOT] Erin [SAYS] Good luck and let me know if you need any help! [EOU] [EOT] Amber [SAYS] Thanks, ttyl. [EOU] [EOT] Erin [SAYS] Bye! [EOU] [EOT]

Martha [SAYS] how do you feel about minimalism? [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] I used to think it's total bullshit [EOU] like, it's still about spending [EOU] but it's about shifting the paradigm from buying cheap to buying expensive stuff. [EOU] [EOT] Martha [SAYS] if expensive lives longer, ofc. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] right. [EOU] [EOT] Martha [SAYS] I'm asking because I just saw this documentary about minimalism gurus [EOU] and I felt mixed about it. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] I think it's a good idea to buy things that will serve you longer [EOU] but it's so difficult to be mindful about everything you buy. [EOU] [EOT] Martha [SAYS] I feel there are so many conflicting priorities when it comes to shopping [EOU] if you want to buy durable stuff you usually pick brands you know, big brands [EOU] and then it might not be fair trade product. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] take leather for example [EOU] if it's ecological it's cruelty free but it has higher carbon footprint than leather. [EOU] [EOT] Martha [SAYS] huh. [EOU] [EOT] Jake [SAYS] so your values clash all the time when you shop. [EOU] [EOT] Martha [SAYS] :( [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Ravi [SAYS] Its probably arthritis. [EOU] The doctor said that it can be controlled, but not cured completely. [EOU] [EOT] Jaya [SAYS] Oh, she had always maintained a healthy lifestyle, I wonder how this happened. [EOU] [EOT] Ravi [SAYS] She did have mild ache in her knees for the past few years but had been ignoring it. [EOU] [EOT] Jaya [SAYS] Did you try naturopathy? [EOU] [EOT] Ravi [SAYS] We tried almost everything. [EOU] [EOT] Jaya [SAYS] Your mother is a strong lady. [EOU] She never gives up so easily.

[EOU] [EOT] Miranda [SAYS] but it's bounced back since, no panic. [EOU] [EOT] Jeff [SAYS] I've listened to some radio podcasts about the American economy [EOU] and it's pretty scary, I mean the economic war on China that Trump is waging and all his unpredictability [EOU] but I'm not an economist. [EOU] [EOT] Peter [SAYS] I know, it's hard to say what may happen because Trump is rather unpredictable [EOU] But people in my bank seem calm, at least 2019 should be calm. [EOU] [EOT] Miranda [SAYS] yup, calm, but the global economy will get weaker [EOU] and the growth will be weaker but not tragic, I suppose. [EOU] [EOT] Jeff [SAYS] and the EU? [EOU] How do you think? [EOU] [EOT] Miranda [SAYS] We just don't know what will happen to the UK and with Brexit [EOU] There are many different scenarios possible [EOU] but it seems that 2020 may be much worse.

[EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] So what is your language? [EOU] [EOT] Samuel [SAYS] It is Telugu, brother. [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] is that spoken in India? [EOU] [EOT] Samuel [SAYS] Yes, in South east India. [EOU] Bangalore and Chennai and other places. [EOU] Nearly 90 million speakers, brother. [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] Is it one of those written right to left? [EOU] [EOT] Samuel [SAYS] No, it is written left to right. [EOU] It is based on Brahmin script, our writing. [EOU] If you trace it back far enough it all comes from the Phoenicians, like English writing the same. [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] Wow. [EOU] So it must be pretty big, then, Teluguland? [EOU] [EOT] Samuel [SAYS] It is 23 provinces, Anna. [EOU] But we are not rich as in the north, so many people here are still working for less than a hundred dollars a whole month. [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] So what is the word for "younger brother" if "Anna" means "elder brother?" [EOU] [EOT] Samuel [SAYS] Thammu or Thammadu. [EOU] You can call me Thammu. [EOU] I am younger than you. [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] how old are you, I would have sid about the same as me in your photo. [EOU] [EOT] Samuel [SAYS] How old are you, Anna? [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] 55 [EOU] [EOT] Samuel [SAYS] Well there you are you see. [EOU] I am 35 only. [EOU] So you are my Anna and I am your Thammadu. [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] Wow sorry to say it but you do look old for 35: [EOU] [EOT] Samuel [SAYS] That is because it is not an easy life when you are not earning much money, Anna. [EOU] We work very hard and have very little. [EOU] But still we are thankful for what we do have. [EOU] [EOT]

Maria [SAYS] Hi Spence, life treating you well? [EOU] [EOT] Spencer [SAYS] Can't complain love, lots of commissions coming in and all that! [EOU] [EOT] Maria [SAYS] Getting your name out there! [EOU] Saw some of your new stuff on Instagram, liked it! [EOU] [EOT] Spencer [SAYS] Yeah, thanks love! [EOU] How's the call centre? [EOU] [EOT] Maria [SAYS] Same old, same old. [EOU] Can't wait to go part time next year, really want to get on with some freelancing. [EOU] [EOT] Spencer [SAYS] Yeah, pity they won't allow it for a year. [EOU] I'm on 16 fixed hours at the cafe which suits me great. [EOU] I've then got the rest of the week to work on my illustrations. [EOU] [EOT] Maria [SAYS] How do you get new clients, Spence? [EOU] I really need to pick your brains sometimes! [EOU] [EOT] Spencer [SAYS] Well, some of them saw my printing in the shops I sell to and contacted me directly, then there's the agency and my social media stuff. [EOU] I probably get around £1000 of work a month now, before commission and tax. [EOU] [EOT] Maria [SAYS] Well that's just about liveable with the cafe wage, I imagine. [EOU] [EOT] Spencer [SAYS] Yes, it's tight, but I am very frugal. [EOU] Still have a hefty chunk going out on rent and bills. [EOU] [EOT] Maria [SAYS] Hmm, I'll have to budget carefully when I do it. [EOU] [EOT] Spencer [SAYS] Yes, but it's well worth it. [EOU] I LOVE the work so much! [EOU] [EOT] Maria [SAYS] Well, your passion is obvious! [EOU] Your stuff is amazing! [EOU] [EOT] Spencer [SAYS] Well, so was yours in Uni. [EOU] Don't let your talent go to waste! [EOU] [EOT] Maria [SAYS] You've inspired me, Spence. [EOU] See you soon, hopefully!

Tim [SAYS] Hey, you have a few minutes? [EOU] [EOT] Joe [SAYS] Sure, what's up? [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] I'm thinking about inviting a few people from work over and I kinda thought that maybe some boardgames would be a cool idea. [EOU] And I wanted to consult the expert on the matter :) [EOU] [EOT] Joe [SAYS] As you know I'm always happy to share my expertise with anyone willing to listen. [EOU] You will just need to stop me when I get too wound up :D [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] Haha :) Ok, So I know you ran the local club - any tips how to organize a newbie gaming evening? [EOU] And what games to bring? [EOU] [EOT] Joe [SAYS] yeah, sure - just a few general tips :) [EOU] Start games before you start drinking :) And don't bring any game that is either over-complicated, requires too much time to explain, or god forbid encourages direct conflict - you know, the plotting-scheming stuff. [EOU] So no Game of Thrones :) [EOU] Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic. [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] Got it :D [EOU] [EOT] Joe [SAYS] Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. [EOU] And if not then there are some 'vanilla' games - like Codenames or Catan. [EOU] Any idea what they might be into? [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls... [EOU] [EOT] Joe [SAYS] The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. [EOU] Maybe some of them are already into gaming? [EOU] There are nerds in every walk of life :) [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] Yeah, I know, all too well :) [EOU] Anyway, thanks for the tips - co-op games sound like a good idea for a start. [EOU] [EOT] Joe [SAYS] yeah, and then if the idea sticks you can roll out the big guns :) [EOU] [EOT] Tim [SAYS] Will do that :) [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Gurdun [SAYS] Anyway, how are things with you? [EOU] [EOT] Russ [SAYS] Same old, same old, you know. [EOU] Not much happening in the middle of term. [EOU] [EOT] Gurdun [SAYS] And the team? [EOU] [EOT] Russ [SAYS] Oh yeah, we won the last match. [EOU] It was a good game. [EOU] [EOT] Gurdun [SAYS] Great. [EOU] Listen Russ, I need to run.

Simon [SAYS] <file_photo> [EOU] It's funny and scary at the same time. [EOU] BTW it's so annoying that people can't see that such immigration policy reduces safety level for citizens of EU significantly. [EOU] [EOT] Charlie [SAYS] This photo is great. [EOU] It totally shows what do we all mean when we criticize EU policy. [EOU] Berlin has put concrete blocks around Christmas fair, Belgium has soldiers running armed around cities and Paris has mass demonstrations and car arsons happening all over the city. [EOU] Poland though... [EOU] One of the last countries unspoilt by uncontrolled migration and terrorism [EOU] The question is - for how long... [EOU] [EOT] Simon [SAYS] I always say that there is advantage of the polish situation [EOU] I mean being economically delayed for few decades [EOU] Poland has a chance to develop in fast pace and at the same time has a position to avoid all the mistakes other western powers made. [EOU] The worst thing is that the country is being ostracized by defending it's values and interests. [EOU] [EOT] Charlie [SAYS] Yup. [EOU] And as long as there are people in Poland ready to defend that values, the country will be marginalized by every other nation. [EOU] [EOT] Simon [SAYS] I admire Poles. [EOU] I admire them for they will to fight. [EOU] They never give up. [EOU] [EOT] Charlie [SAYS] Different countries tried to eliminate them from the map. [EOU] [EOT] Simon [SAYS] I tell you, there will be time, when only Poland will have power to fight with internal problems of Europe. [EOU] [EOT] Charlie [SAYS] Maybe. [EOU] But there is a risk that internal conflict will rip the country apart. [EOU] [EOT] Simon [SAYS] Let's hope not. [EOU] [EOT] Charlie [SAYS] Yup. [EOU] To conclude: Christmas in Poland will be the best Christmas in Europe :D [EOU] [EOT] Simon [SAYS] I agree :) [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Tilly [SAYS] They are useless. [EOU] They are supposed to tell your parents if you get a detention. [EOU] [EOT] Sam [SAYS] How long will you be? [EOU] [EOT] Tilly [SAYS] About 40 minutes. [EOU] [EOT] Sam [SAYS] OK.. [EOU] I'm going back to mine - phone me when you are home. [EOU] [EOT] Tilly [SAYS] OK - see you soon. [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] An odd phone call with the kids. [EOU] Or Tad's sister:(( Not much otherwise. [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] Yeah... [EOU] Life has become so quite since the kids are out of the house. [EOU] We had more to get used to it. [EOU] But it must hard for you. [EOU] Especially you I mean. [EOU] [EOT] Mell [SAYS] I don't know. [EOU] Sometimes I even forget that I should be missing them. [EOU] In a way I do like this peace and quiet now. [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] Small wonder. [EOU] You had a hell of a time with them just before they went to college. [EOU] I'd say you need to recover now. [EOU] [EOT] Mell [SAYS] I guess you're right. [EOU] But maybe I should feel guilty or something? [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] Don't be silly! [EOU] You are a fantastic mom. [EOU] [EOT] Mell [SAYS] Thanks Gloria. [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] Anyway I'm happy to hear from you again. [EOU] We should really have a nice do again.

[EOU] I must show you my drawings, just a few ideas. [EOU] It would be great to hear your opinion. [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] I'd love to. [EOU] But you know how little I know about garden design, or however you call it. [EOU] [EOT] Mell [SAYS] We'll have a look at them. [EOU] Now the BBQ. [EOU] At the weekend I suppose? [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] Let me check the calendar. [EOU] Here's our family planner. [EOU] A horrible name, isn't it? [EOU] So this weekend suits us fine. [EOU] At the next one, on Saturday, Mark has penciled something in but I can't read it. [EOU] So what about this Saturday? [EOU] [EOT] Mell [SAYS] Perfect. [EOU] At least we know the weather holds. [EOU] Shall I do the food and you the drinks? [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] And I'll get us some dessert as well. [EOU] [EOT] Mell [SAYS] Very good indeed. [EOU] It's always so easy going with you. [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] Ta! [EOU] You were thinking about Tad's sister? [EOU] [EOT] Mell [SAYS] I'm afraid so. [EOU] I'm so happy she moved up to Scotland and I don't have to put up with her trying to run my household. [EOU] Tad feels relieved too. [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] Good riddance! [EOU] I could really never warm up to her. [EOU] [EOT] Mell [SAYS] Nobody can! [EOU] Anyway she's gone and we're going to have a fantastic barbecue. [EOU] Without her. [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] Yes, we are. [EOU] Oh I'm so happy you've phoned! [EOU] [EOT] Mell [SAYS] Looking forward to our BBQ on Saturday! [EOU] [EOT] Gloria [SAYS] So long! [EOU] [EOT]

Mia [SAYS] God, he keeps talking about the stupid wall. [EOU] [EOT] Jennifer [SAYS] I think he's just senile. [EOU] [EOT] Karine [SAYS] unfortunately it's much more [EOU] this populist strategy to scare people with a minority [EOU] and then present himself as the only savior. [EOU] [EOT] Peter [SAYS] Karine is right, I think he's not as senile and stupid as we would like to believe. [EOU] [EOT] Mia [SAYS] so it's even worse - he's pure evil. [EOU] [EOT] Peter [SAYS] possibly yes. [EOU] [EOT] Karine [SAYS] I really think so, because it's not only about politics anymore [EOU] he is destroying the Earth [EOU] trying to shake the world's order. [EOU] [EOT] Jennifer [SAYS] but he's also quite stupid [EOU] and the dangerous thing is his self confidence [EOU] he's persistence [EOU] and ignorance. [EOU] [EOT] Karine [SAYS] but we have a chance to change it [EOU] maybe Trump will be over soon? [EOU] [EOT] Mia [SAYS] we will see [EOU] but we should do anything to win the next elections. [EOU] [EOT] Karine [SAYS] everything! [EOU] [EOT]

Andy [SAYS] Hello. [EOU] I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room. [EOU] [EOT] Betty [SAYS] Hello Andy. [EOU] Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? [EOU] [EOT] Andy [SAYS] I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows. [EOU] [EOT] Betty [SAYS] Why is that? [EOU] [EOT] Andy [SAYS] Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. [EOU] On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow. [EOU] [EOT] Betty [SAYS] So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? [EOU] but not in other rooms? [EOU] [EOT] Andy [SAYS] Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls. [EOU] [EOT] Betty [SAYS] so why only that bedroom and not the other ones? [EOU] [EOT] Andy [SAYS] I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen. [EOU] [EOT] Betty [SAYS] But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then? [EOU] [EOT] Andy [SAYS] I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. [EOU] The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees. [EOU] [EOT] Betty [SAYS] Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation? [EOU] [EOT] Andy [SAYS] Not necessarily. [EOU] that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else. [EOU] [EOT] Betty [SAYS] So what would you recommend? [EOU] [EOT] Andy [SAYS] I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. [EOU] It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. [EOU] [EOT] Betty [SAYS] That sounds good. [EOU] would that be sufficient? [EOU] [EOT] Andy [SAYS] If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. [EOU] That will not go away by itself. [EOU] [EOT] Betty [SAYS] OK, is this something your company can help with? [EOU] [EOT] Andy [SAYS] It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. [EOU] [EOT] Betty [SAYS] Good point. [EOU] Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email? [EOU] [EOT] Andy [SAYS] Of course, I will have that done by Friday. [EOU] [EOT] Betty [SAYS] That would be great. [EOU] And again, thanks for today! [EOU] [EOT] Andy [SAYS] No problem, speak soon. [EOU] [EOT]
Gina [SAYS] did u lock the door. [EOU] [EOT] Warren [SAYS] yes. [EOU] [EOT] Gina [SAYS] good, thanks [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Aaron [SAYS] i was thinking i could go to Jo's lecture. [EOU] [EOT] Claire [SAYS] Jo's... [EOU] is it the one about stress? [EOU] [EOT] Aaron [SAYS] no, that's Joe ;D Jo is having a workshop on teamwork. [EOU] [EOT] Claire [SAYS] ah, this one. [EOU] yeah looks interesting. [EOU] [EOT] Aaron [SAYS] i know her, she's a really good coach. [EOU] [EOT] Claire [SAYS] i was thinking maybe mindfullness... [EOU] [EOT] Aaron [SAYS] yeah definitely!! [EOU] if you haven't been to any mindfullness workshops then it's a must! [EOU] i've taken it in Berlin last year, with the same guy [EOU] it was amazing, life-changing i'd say. [EOU] [EOT] Claire [SAYS] sounds wonderful [EOU] one can easily tell you're one of the organisers ;D. [EOU] [EOT] Aaron [SAYS] hahah yeah but we did choose the best topics and presenters, believe me :D [EOU] we've checked out all those people and learnt from them and yeah, they're the best ;) [EOU] [EOT] Claire [SAYS] ok ok i'm signing up :D see you there, during the breaks at least;) [EOU] [EOT] Aaron [SAYS] ok bye bye;) [EOU] [EOT]
Kate [SAYS] I've just heard you want to sell your flat?! [EOU] [EOT] Rob [SAYS] That's true. [EOU] Do you want to buy it? [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] Ha ha! [EOU] I wish.. [EOU] [EOT] Rob [SAYS] I'll give you a discount ;) [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] Sure. [EOU] You moved in a year ago or so?! [EOU] Why do you wanna sell it? [EOU] [EOT] Rob [SAYS] We're thinking about having a baby and it is too small. [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] It's not that bad. [EOU] Mine is smaller and I have two. [EOU] [EOT] Rob [SAYS] There's no room for a cot in our bedroom. [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] You're right. [EOU] So are you looking for two bed now? [EOU] [EOT] Rob [SAYS] Three bed would be perfect so that we won't have to move out again when we decide to have another baby. [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] That's sounds reasonable. [EOU] [EOT] Rob [SAYS] I know. [EOU] It just the prices.. [EOU] total madness!!! [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] I can only imagine. [EOU] It's getting more expensive year after year. [EOU] [EOT] Rob [SAYS] I've got a friend who's relocating to another city so want to sell his flat ASAP and offers a good price. [EOU] We're seeing him tomorrow. [EOU] [EOT] Kate [SAYS] Good luck with that! [EOU] ;) [EOU] [EOT] Rob [SAYS] Fingers crossed! [EOU] ;) [EOU] [EOT]
Allison [SAYS] You talked to Ethan about the function? [EOU] [EOT] Evan [SAYS] Yeah I did. [EOU] [EOT] Allison [SAYS] What did he say? [EOU] [EOT] Evan [SAYS] He might not come. [EOU] [EOT] Allison [SAYS] Can you do something about that? [EOU] [EOT] Evan [SAYS] I will try to make him come. [EOU] [EOT] Allison [SAYS] K [EOU] [EOT]
Charlie [SAYS] How are you doing. [EOU] [EOT] Daisy [SAYS] Good, seeing a lot of beautiful places. [EOU] [EOT] Charlie [SAYS] Where are you now? [EOU] [EOT] Daisy [SAYS] in Naples. [EOU] [EOT] Charlie [SAYS] Pity, I hoped you may be still in Sicily. [EOU] [EOT] Daisy [SAYS] No, we took a ferry early in the morning yesterday.

[EOU] I tend to forget things but I do remember my past girlfriends [EOU] and believe me none was named Claire. [EOU] [EOT] Maddie [SAYS] Weird [EOU] Maybe she was thinking about someone else? [EOU] [EOT] Ian [SAYS] most likely [EOU] I barely know her [EOU] I think we met for the first time like 1,5 years ago. [EOU] [EOT] Maddie [SAYS] I'll ask her next time [EOU] Sorry about the confusion. [EOU] [EOT] Ian [SAYS] don't worry [EOU] take care! [EOU] [EOT]
Violet [SAYS] hi! [EOU] :) [EOU] do you know any good waxing salon in the neighbourhood? [EOU] i'm going on vacation and i'm as hairy as a gorilla :o XD. [EOU] [EOT] Paisley [SAYS] waxing? [EOU] wow, girl, you're brave :p [EOU] i've been in a waxing salon once and i'm not going back [EOU] waxing is painful af. [EOU] [EOT] Violet [SAYS] was it that bad? [EOU] [EOT] Paisley [SAYS] leg waxing was ok-ish, but bikini... [EOU] jesus [EOU] i was bleeding so fckin hard [EOU] blood was EVERYWHERE. [EOU] [EOT] Violet [SAYS] !!! [EOU] i was going to get brazilian waxing, but now i'm scared. [EOU] [EOT] Paisley [SAYS] that's extreme :o [EOU] if i were you, i'd start from leg waxing or sugaring [EOU] but why won't you just shave down there? [EOU] ingrown hairs? [EOU] [EOT] Violet [SAYS] yup [EOU] i use scrubs and moisturize my skin almost every day but it's still bad [EOU] i mean REALLY BAD, i look like a freaking chicken with all these razor bumps. [EOU] [EOT] Paisley [SAYS] try shaving with the grain [EOU] it helped with my ingrows. [EOU] [EOT] Violet [SAYS] i've tried everything [EOU] i just need to man up and make an appointment. [EOU] [EOT] Paisley [SAYS] good luck, then ;) [EOU] [EOT] Violet [SAYS] thanks [EOU] [EOT]

Sean [SAYS] Friendly reminder of trade deadline today. [EOU] Let's get those last minute trade request sent. [EOU] [EOT] Rick [SAYS] So does John get Lamar Jackson or is he scrambling for another qb?? [EOU] [EOT] Sean [SAYS] Nick needs to really think about rolling with Blake. [EOU] John needs a QB! [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] I think I would have rights to Lamar but I think the consensus is that he's on waivers so he's open. [EOU] I guess I'm just hoping RGIII and Brock play or just wait... [EOU] [EOT] Rick [SAYS] Crazy it happens though! [EOU] he one thing in the chart that isn't addressed. [EOU] We could vote and go from there. [EOU] I just want you to lose a player and Nick not to get Lamar. [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] In 15 years I've never seen a ream trade a big time RB or WR for a QB this late n the season do anything in the playoffs. [EOU] That ends their season. [EOU] Of course a one QB team isn't worth anything either. [EOU] I have t take my chances. [EOU] [EOT] Sean [SAYS] Damned if you do, damned if you don't. [EOU] [EOT] Rick [SAYS] people's evidence #658 why the QB rule doesn't work. [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] I might have a way to drop the rule completely next year. [EOU] [EOT] Sean [SAYS] I guess we will have to talk about after the season. [EOU] [EOT] Rick [SAYS] Nobody liked my IR suggestion a couple of years ago. [EOU] That solves a large percentage of the issue tho. [EOU] [EOT] Sean [SAYS] 1 QB not 2 for a 14 league... [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] as I said, we can look at if after the season. [EOU] I just wouldn't want to make it any easier. [EOU] What has made the league so great its that it has been really difficult so far. [EOU] [EOT]
Lisa [SAYS] have you ever heard about this diet?? [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] [EOT] Victoria [SAYS] Nooo [EOU] Hmm, seems interesting. [EOU] [EOT] Amelia [SAYS] YES!! [EOU] My mum was on that crazy diet..... [EOU] She gained 5 pounds (ー_ー)!! [EOU] [EOT] Lisa [SAYS] omg, glad that I asked [EOU] <file_gif>  [EOU] [EOT]
Carrie [SAYS] Just back from Fantastic Beast :) [EOU] [EOT] Gina [SAYS] and what do you think? [EOU] [EOT] Carrie [SAYS] generally good - as usual nice special effect and visuals, an ok plot, a glimpse of the wizarding community in the US. [EOU] [EOT] Alex [SAYS] Sounds cool. [EOU] I was thinking of going this weekend with Lane, but I've seen some bad reviews. [EOU] [EOT] Carrie [SAYS] Depends on what you expect really - I have a lot of sentiment towards Harry Potter so, I'm gonna like everything the do. [EOU] But seriously the movie was decent. [EOU] However, if you're expecting to have your mind blown, then no, it's not THAT good. [EOU] [EOT] Gina [SAYS] I agree. [EOU] I saw it last week and basically I'm satisfied. [EOU] [EOT] Alex [SAYS] No spoilers, girls. [EOU] [EOT] Carrie [SAYS] no worries ;) [EOU] And Gina, what do you think about Eddie Redmayne as Newt? [EOU] [EOT] Gina [SAYS] I loved him <3 I loved how introverted and awkward he was and how caring he was towards the animals. [EOU] And with all that he showed a lot of confidence in his beliefs and was a genuinely compassionate character. [EOU] [EOT] Carrie [SAYS] not your standard protagonist, that's for sure. [EOU] [EOT] Gina [SAYS] and that's what I liked about him. [EOU] [EOT] Alex [SAYS] Maybe I'll go and see it sooner so we can all talk about it. [EOU] [EOT] Carrie [SAYS] go see it. [EOU] If' you're not expecting god-knows-what you're going to enjoy it ;) [EOU] [EOT]
Amelia [SAYS] What is your favourite colour? [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] Blue, why? [EOU] [EOT] Amelia [SAYS] I can't tell you. [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] A surprise?

[EOU] [EOT] Shanon [SAYS] Bt y? [EOU] [EOT] Sid [SAYS] He got fired 2day and thrown out of school? [EOU] [EOT] Oliver [SAYS] Literally thrown out! [EOU] [EOT] Shanon [SAYS] What?! [EOU] [EOT] Victor [SAYS] I suppose he's had it and lost it. [EOU] [EOT] Oliver [SAYS] Or maybe had one too many ;) [EOU] [EOT] Sid [SAYS] Not. [EOU] Our. [EOU] Teacher. [EOU] Anymore! [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Pedro [SAYS] whats so good about the flash :P. [EOU] [EOT] Alex [SAYS] duuude, he can do almost anything. [EOU] [EOT] Pedro [SAYS] not anything. [EOU] [EOT] Alex [SAYS] yea im sure batman can run as fast -_- [EOU] [EOT] Pedro [SAYS] superhuman speed? [EOU] thats your pitch? [EOU] [EOT] Alex [SAYS] that speed opens up the whole multiverse for him.. [EOU] you seriously dont get how powerful he can be. [EOU] [EOT] Pedro [SAYS] yeah i get your point [EOU] [EOT]
Marek [SAYS] bro, check this out [EOU] <file_picture> [EOU] [EOT] Adam [SAYS] whoa, that's some fine piece of ass [EOU] where did you find it?

[EOU] [EOT] Marek [SAYS] pretty cool, isn't it. [EOU] [EOT] Adam [SAYS] dude, that's creppy [EOU] one thing is to send me pic of nice ass, it's always appreciated [EOU] but another is to walk around and take pictures on your own [EOU] like some creep [EOU] think about it, she might have been someone's sister or daughter. [EOU] [EOT] Marek [SAYS] dude [EOU] this is some guy's ass [EOU] I'm a gay, remember? [EOU] [EOT] Adam [SAYS] shit [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Kai [SAYS] are you not tired of all this travelling? [EOU] [EOT] Michael [SAYS] hmm, a little bit but not really. [EOU] I’m more scared to stay in London and do nothing, because I’m so bored of it. [EOU] [EOT] Kai [SAYS] I see, a man full of energy :) [EOU] [EOT] Michael [SAYS] well sort of, for fun stuff, but tired of work. [EOU] [EOT] Kai [SAYS] yes, I remember quite well 😋 [EOU] [EOT] Michael [SAYS] Hahah. [EOU] Thinking of resigning earlier than I was planning. [EOU] [EOT] Kai [SAYS] and then? [EOU] [EOT] Michael [SAYS] I don’t have an answer to that one yet, and it’s not really a solution because I’d need to work 2 months notice period anyway, but I’ve just lost motivation after 3 years. [EOU] [EOT] Kai [SAYS] Would you like to leave London? [EOU] [EOT] Michael [SAYS] yes asap. [EOU] [EOT] Kai [SAYS] for the Netherlands? [EOU] [EOT] Michael [SAYS] maybe to recharge and look for jobs abroad, but I don't want to stay there. [EOU] I know it’s not smart to quit without an alternative.

[EOU] Anyway I need to speak to my manager and discuss because I’m not happy in my job now. [EOU] How’s everything on your side? [EOU] too much work? [EOU] [EOT] Kai [SAYS] yes, I basically never rest these days. [EOU] [EOT] Michael [SAYS] that’s not good, you need rest to avoid a burnout, which I had just before I went on holiday. [EOU] [EOT] Kai [SAYS] Probably, I have a conference 8th of Dec, then I'll rest a bit, I hope. [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Stefano [SAYS] The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know. [EOU] [EOT] Josie [SAYS] And what about Foucault's Pendulum? [EOU] [EOT] Stefano [SAYS] Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. [EOU] The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel. [EOU] [EOT] Josie [SAYS] Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s. [EOU] [EOT] Stefano [SAYS] Really? [EOU] What did he say? [EOU] [EOT] Josie [SAYS] He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game. [EOU] [EOT] Stefano [SAYS] What? [EOU] Rotfl! [EOU] [EOT] Josie [SAYS] That's what Salman said... [EOU] [EOT] Stefano [SAYS] Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum... [EOU] [EOT] Josie [SAYS] De gustiBus! [EOU] [EOT] Stefano [SAYS] I know, it was a typo! [EOU] [EOT] Josie [SAYS] Disgusting pus! [EOU] [EOT] Stefano [SAYS] Hahaha. [EOU] [EOT] Josie [SAYS] Yuk! [EOU] That's so creepy. [EOU] [EOT] Stefano [SAYS] You're the one who said it! [EOU] [EOT] Josie [SAYS] I know. [EOU] ;) [EOU] [EOT]

Bobby [SAYS] U know what annoys me the most? [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] Not being able to watch TV or listen to music without pesky interruptions? [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] That too, but the thing that annoys me the most is pharmaceuticals, medicine and drugs. [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] Y? [EOU] Aren't they good 4 ur health? [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] They may well be, but not for my wallet! [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] What do u mean? [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] I was watching a film last night and suddenly there's a bunch of commercial of different medical products and so on. [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] And what of it? [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] Imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses! [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] What? [EOU] Are u sure? [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] No, I'm not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of. [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] So what? [EOU] There are many illnesses and diseases I've never heard of. [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] So I did some research. [EOU] Turns out such a thing does not exist. [EOU] No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution. [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] I even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it's not an illness. [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] All right, this is quite serious. [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] So I put my mind to it and do u know what I came up with? [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] What? [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] That in this particular case they're selling mints as medical products! [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] Srsly?! [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] Absolutely! [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] How long do u think they've been lying to us? [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] Can't be sure, but probably 4ever. [EOU] Imagine every illness, disease and so on. [EOU] Where do these come from? [EOU] Why do they spread so fast? [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] That is kinda puzzling. [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] Right? [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] So why is no one doing anything about it? [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] Do u know how much the pharmaceutical industry is worth today? [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] No. [EOU] [EOT] Bobby [SAYS] At least $1.2 bln! [EOU] [EOT] Mickey [SAYS] Explains a lot. [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] You don't even realize what this "1 inteview" means for my parents. [EOU] They're just like: "We're glad that you found yourself a decent man" [EOU] [EOT] Pete [SAYS] Hahaha. [EOU] I'm flattered :) I'll be home in 1 hour. [EOU]  [EOU] [EOT]
Iris [SAYS] Anyone know how to fix this? [EOU] Trying to remove myself from an expense: > This expense involves a person who has left the group, and thus it can no longer be edited. [EOU] If you wish to change this expense, you must first add that person back to your group. [EOU] [EOT] Ken [SAYS] You got the email address of the person? [EOU] [EOT] Iris [SAYS] Doesn't say. [EOU] But probably juls? [EOU] [EOT] Luke [SAYS] Probably have to delete that expense and re-add it. [EOU] [EOT] Iris [SAYS] I’m gonna try. [EOU] [EOT] Luke [SAYS] It's the car right? [EOU] [EOT] Ken [SAYS] yip. [EOU] [EOT] Iris [SAYS] gracias. [EOU] [EOT] Ken [SAYS] fixed it - absorbed Juls extra cost so we can remove her from the group again. [EOU] [EOT] Gerardo [SAYS] We will need to add her towards the car rental price. [EOU] [EOT] Ken [SAYS] true that - let me know when you are doing that and I'll add her back in. [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] Ooops, that’d be me. [EOU] [EOT] Ken [SAYS] No worries, we got this :) [EOU] [EOT] Julia [SAYS] let me know how much I owe u so I can wire :) [EOU] [EOT] Ken [SAYS] I guess by the end of the month – something unpredicted always pops up in the meantime so we have to recalculate again. [EOU] [EOT] Gerardo [SAYS] Speaking of which, I’m gonna ask the peeps leaving early to stay in the splitwise group until the end of the month. [EOU] [EOT] Ken [SAYS] Sara, George. [EOU] [EOT] George [SAYS] We will, my man. [EOU] [EOT] Gerardo [SAYS] It’s gonna be the $ for gas too [EOU] [EOT]

Jess [SAYS] Guys, last night I dreamt I was a lion tamer, does it mean I should go to Africa this summer? [EOU] XD. [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] Or maybe you'll meet a handsome zookeeper? [EOU] :D [EOU] [EOT] Charlie [SAYS] Or you'll get attacked by a stray cat? [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] You've just spoiled all the fun! [EOU] :P. [EOU] [EOT] Jess [SAYS] Knowing my luck, Charlie might be the closest to the truth. [EOU] [EOT] Charlie [SAYS] Do you really believe that dreams can mean something? [EOU] [EOT] Jess [SAYS] No, of course not! [EOU] I was just joking. [EOU] It was such a surreal dream that I had to share it with you ;) [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] Well... [EOU] [EOT] Jess [SAYS] Do you believe in dreams, Lynn? [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] I'm not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. [EOU] Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it's just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don't you think? [EOU] [EOT] Jess [SAYS] I guess? [EOU] [EOT] Charlie [SAYS] I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. [EOU] Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream. [EOU] [EOT] Jess [SAYS] So you're telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood? [EOU] [EOT] Charlie [SAYS] Exactly! [EOU] You don't even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage. [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] WOW, it sounds really cool! [EOU] [EOT]
Charles [SAYS] How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance? [EOU] [EOT] Karen [SAYS] You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten. [EOU] From what I've heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but I don't think may lead to your death. [EOU] [EOT] Jack [SAYS] Why are you asking? [EOU] Is there something wrong? [EOU] [EOT] Charles [SAYS] Hm, I don't know, I feel that I may be allergic or something. [EOU] [EOT] Monica [SAYS] Do you have any symptoms? [EOU] Check those articles: [EOU] <file_other>, <file_other> [EOU] [EOT] Karen [SAYS] I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me [EOU] When it comes to intolerance... [EOU] I know it's very hip to be gluten intolerant, but I don't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. [EOU] Unless you have a coeliac disease, I think you're fine. [EOU] [EOT] Jack [SAYS] My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine. [EOU] [EOT] Charles [SAYS] I may do it as well. [EOU] I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much. [EOU] [EOT] Karen [SAYS] But do you feel differently after eating gluten? [EOU] Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. [EOU] Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better. [EOU] [EOT] Monica [SAYS] I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. [EOU] I stopped eating it and I'm much better now. [EOU] [EOT] Jack [SAYS] But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this? [EOU] [EOT] Monica [SAYS] It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. [EOU] I don't know how it works, but it happens. [EOU] [EOT] Charles [SAYS] I think it's the same with me. [EOU] I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare. [EOU] [EOT] Karen [SAYS] You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. [EOU] Maybe it has nothing to do with food? [EOU] [EOT] Charles [SAYS] I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. [EOU] My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet. [EOU] [EOT] Karen [SAYS] It may be, but I'm not so sure. [EOU] Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm. [EOU] [EOT] Monica [SAYS] You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat. [EOU] [EOT] Charles [SAYS] Thanks! [EOU] I'm really worried, because it's getting worse and I have no idea what's happening with me [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Ophelia [SAYS] it's from Crazy Lenses. [EOU] They have quite reasonable prices and very fast shipping. [EOU] [EOT] Martha [SAYS] Thanks!!!
