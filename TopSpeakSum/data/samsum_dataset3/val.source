[EOU] My sister adds notes asking her kids questions about christmas such as What did the 3 wise men bring? [EOU] etc. [EOU] [EOT] Lauren [SAYS] i reckon it prepares them for Christmas. [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] and makes it more about traditions and being kind to other people. [EOU] [EOT] Lauren [SAYS] my children get very excited every time they get one! [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] i can see why! [EOU] :) [EOU] [EOT]
Jackie [SAYS] Madison is pregnant [EOU] but she doesn't wanna talk about it. [EOU] [EOT] Iggy [SAYS] why. [EOU] [EOT] Jackie [SAYS] I don't know why because she doesn't wanna talk about it. [EOU] [EOT] Iggy [SAYS] ok. [EOU] [EOT] Jackie [SAYS] I wanted to prepare you for it because people get super excited and ask lots of questions [EOU] and she looked way more anxious than excited. [EOU] [EOT] Iggy [SAYS] she's probably worrying about it [EOU] she's taking every commitment really seriously. [EOU] [EOT] Jackie [SAYS] it could be money problems or relationship problems. [EOU] [EOT] Iggy [SAYS] or maybe she wants an abortion. [EOU] [EOT] Jackie [SAYS] it could be all of the above. [EOU] [EOT] Iggy [SAYS] but you know what? [EOU] once my friend was pregnant and I couldn't bring myself to be happy about it. [EOU] [EOT] Jackie [SAYS] why? [EOU] [EOT] Iggy [SAYS] I felt they were immature and I couldn't picture this couple as parents. [EOU] [EOT] Jackie [SAYS] I felt similar way on Patricia's wedding. [EOU] [EOT] Iggy [SAYS] Patricia Stevens? [EOU] [EOT] Jackie [SAYS] yes. [EOU] [EOT] Iggy [SAYS] so we're talking about the same person. [EOU] [EOT] Jackie [SAYS] what a coincidence [EOU] so she's pregnant? [EOU] [EOT] Iggy [SAYS] she thought she was. [EOU] [EOT] Jackie [SAYS] damn... [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] wtf is wrong with people. [EOU] [EOT] Kiki [SAYS] she or he could be too wasted to notice. [EOU] [EOT] Tamara [SAYS] or maybe someone put their pants there to piss you off. [EOU] [EOT] Marla [SAYS] that makes no sense [EOU] it's so fucking childish. [EOU] [EOT] Kiki [SAYS] if it's childish then it must have been your sister's idea. [EOU] [EOT] Marla [SAYS] she's 13, she doesn't have underwear that isn't pink. [EOU] [EOT] Tamara [SAYS] maybe it belonged to one of your exes? [EOU] [EOT] Kiki [SAYS] she would have recognized it.

[EOU] [EOT] Franklin [SAYS] But what should I do? [EOU] [EOT] Faye [SAYS] Try to give him a bottle, if he doesn't want, change his diapers, if not, take him in your arms, it often works.

[EOU] [EOT] Carmen [SAYS] So the baby is not in danger anymore. [EOU] [EOT] Diego [SAYS] From what I understood all is under control. [EOU] [EOT] Marcel [SAYS] Maybe she'll have to stay there until the end of her pregnancy. [EOU] [EOT] Carmen [SAYS] She's already 30 weeks pregnant. [EOU] Maybe it's better that she stays under doctors' control [EOU] In case something happens [EOU] But it must be tough to stay in the hospital bed all these weeks [EOU] [EOT]

Kirk [SAYS] So they've just decided to move the capital. [EOU] [EOT] Jenny [SAYS] how silly, they think they will escape the problems this way? [EOU] [EOT] Abdi [SAYS] seems so. [EOU] [EOT] Marvin [SAYS] I've never been to Gitega, seems a shithole :P. [EOU] [EOT] Abdi [SAYS] it's 20 or so times smaller than Bujumbura. [EOU] [EOT] Marvin [SAYS] exactly. [EOU] [EOT] Kirk [SAYS] and the costs it will generate. [EOU] [EOT] Abdi [SAYS] but it will take some time. [EOU] [EOT] Kirk [SAYS] they say about 3 years. [EOU] [EOT] Jenny [SAYS] anyway, Nkurunziza promised it in 2007, didn't he? [EOU] [EOT] Kirk [SAYS] he did [EOU] I think something similar was made in Birma at some point by the regime there [EOU] to just avoid protests and clashes. [EOU] [EOT] Jenny [SAYS] do they have any city planning project for Gitega? [EOU] [EOT] Kirk [SAYS] I've no idea. [EOU] [EOT] Marvin [SAYS] So you think it's for political reasons? [EOU] [EOT] Kirk [SAYS] at least partially. [EOU] [EOT] Jenny [SAYS] to avoid being toppled by some city unrests in Bujumbura [EOU] there he will have more control over space [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] Maybe is time we trade in our old friend too. [EOU] [EOT] Jessy [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] I was thinking about it too. [EOU] But this time I think I would want an SUV. [EOU] They have much more space. [EOU] [EOT] Clara [SAYS] Do you have any specific brand in mind? [EOU] [EOT] Jessy [SAYS] I was thinking about Infinity or Toyota too. [EOU] [EOT] Clara [SAYS] Those are nice cars.

Luigi [SAYS] Geez, Mayweather totally destroyed McGregor! [EOU] Did you watch gentlemen?? [EOU] [EOT] Lorenzo [SAYS] I'm not very much into boxing, rather prefer MMA but the buzz about this fight made me watch it [EOU] And yeah, the black guy seemed to be only defending himself for a few rounds but at the same time Conor lost much of his stamina. [EOU] [EOT] Pablo [SAYS] Whatta hell are you two talking about?? [EOU] McGregor and boxing?? [EOU] He's an mma warrior, those R 2 different worlds! [EOU] Wtf [EOU] And Mayweather?? [EOU] He's fuckin 40, he's to fuckin old to fight! [EOU] [EOT] Luigi [SAYS] Hahaha Pablito :D [EOU] You follow UFC events and you know mcgregor's a freak and likes to provoke people. [EOU] [EOT] Pablo [SAYS] Aight but those R people from mma that he provokes, not from fuckin boxing! [EOU] He's fuckin one unpredictable piece of bastard. [EOU] [EOT] Lorenzo [SAYS] You better watch your mouth Pablo cause if Conor finds out what you're sayin, you'll be the next xD. [EOU] [EOT] Pablo [SAYS] Sheit dudes, that's a fuckin nonsense [EOU] But anyway... [EOU] Mayweather won, you've said that. [EOU] And McGregor? [EOU] Was he sharp? [EOU] [EOT] Luigi [SAYS] He was, actually I was surprised cause he was fighting pretty well for 5 maybe 6 rounds [EOU] Floyd had to keep his guard up and seemed to have little chances cuz the Irishman was attacking again an again [EOU] But you know, Floyd is an old bird and all this time he was waiting for Conor to get tired and you know the rest :) [EOU] [EOT] Pablo [SAYS] Experience bitch, he beat 'The Notorious' thanks to his fuckin experience! [EOU] [EOT] Luigi [SAYS] No doubt about it, bro. [EOU] [EOT] Lorenzo [SAYS] But you know, Mcgregor's never fought 10 rounds, in MMA 3 rounds is the limit. [EOU] [EOT] Pablo [SAYS] True. [EOU] [EOT] Lorenzo [SAYS] So what if they agreed for a rematch on the mma rules?? [EOU] :) [EOU] [EOT] Pablo [SAYS] Duuuuuude [EOU] Conor would destroy him, no doubt. [EOU] [EOT] Luigi [SAYS] Who knows, maybe they've been planning two differnt fights, who knows :) [EOU] [EOT] Pablo [SAYS] Hope so, I'm goin to fuckin wait for the fight even if it would be at 4 am. [EOU] [EOT] Lorenzo [SAYS] Good old Pablo... [EOU] I love your temperament you son of a bitch. [EOU] [EOT] Pablo [SAYS] Yeah, you're not the first bitch to say that. [EOU] [EOT] Luigi [SAYS] Lol xD [EOU] [EOT]
Emily [SAYS] Hi, so what do u think about the change of ENG teachers? [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] Hi, well I must admit that I was quite surprised. [EOU] I don't really understand why we weren't informed b4 March break. [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] I think they didn't want us 2 panic during our holidays. [EOU] The school was closed 4 2wks so no one would be available to deal with our Qs & concerns. [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] You might be right. [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] And I'm sure the new teacher is highly qualified. [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] Yeah, she has an MA in education & she's a native Canadian speaker. [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] Oh, I didn't know that. [EOU] So she will teach our kids a true & correct accent :) [EOU] [EOT] Sophie [SAYS] Annie seems to already like her. [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] Jenny is also happy. [EOU] She says that the classes are very fun & interesting. [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Monica [SAYS] Hmm, too early? [EOU] [EOT] Rachel [SAYS] I think it's pointless to be there 3 hours earlier. [EOU] [EOT] Monica [SAYS] So what? [EOU] the next shuttle is at 5.30 [EOU] [EOT] Rachel [SAYS] We can just take a public bus at about 4 [EOU] [EOT] Monica [SAYS] ok, as you prefer! [EOU]  [EOU] [EOT]

Kyle [SAYS] Who wants to go out for a drink? [EOU] [EOT] Megan [SAYS] No, sorry, I'm cleaning the house today. [EOU] [EOT] Roseanne [SAYS] You've always loved cleaning, haven't you? [EOU] I remember how angry you used to get with your brother for leaving a mess in the kitchen. [EOU] [EOT] Vince [SAYS] Yeah, she'd always yell at me, even though I was the one in charge when our parents were away. [EOU] [EOT] Kyle [SAYS] I don't get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. [EOU] No one died from a bit of dust. [EOU] [EOT] Megan [SAYS] Remind me to never stay at your place :P. [EOU] [EOT] Roseanne [SAYS] I'm somewhere in between. [EOU] My house is always a mess, but I hate it when it's dirty. [EOU] [EOT] Vince [SAYS] What's the difference? [EOU] [EOT] Roseanne [SAYS] I can't stand when there's dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so I clean regularly. [EOU] But I love it when all my stuff just lies around. [EOU] When I put everything back on shelves or into cabinets, I keep on getting mad that I have to look for it, get up and take it out, and generally lose so much time. [EOU] I like to have everything within my reach. [EOU] [EOT] Vince [SAYS] There's no better wardrobe than the armchair, right? [EOU] XD. [EOU] [EOT] Kyle [SAYS] I prefer the floor. [EOU] There's more space on it :D [EOU] [EOT] Megan [SAYS] Just reading this gives me the creeps. [EOU] [EOT] Kyle [SAYS] Fine, go back to cleaning, we'll think of you while sharing a beer :D [EOU] [EOT] Roseanne [SAYS] Hey, I never said I can come. [EOU] My hubby's away this weekend, so I have no one to leave the kids with ;( [EOU] [EOT] Vince [SAYS] Take them to Megan's place, they can help her clean :D [EOU] [EOT] Megan [SAYS] You know what? [EOU] I don't care. [EOU] I can watch your kids, Roseanne. [EOU] Just bring them over. [EOU] [EOT] Roseanne [SAYS] But are you serious or just mad at us? [EOU] [EOT] Megan [SAYS] No, I'm serious. [EOU] I like your kids. [EOU] And they're nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it :D [EOU] [EOT] Roseanne [SAYS] LOL, okay. [EOU] Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun. [EOU] [EOT] Vince [SAYS] And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? [EOU] :D [EOU] [EOT] Roseanne [SAYS] Exactly. [EOU] But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. [EOU] They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job. [EOU] [EOT] Kyle [SAYS] Do they pay him? [EOU] :P. [EOU] [EOT] Roseanne [SAYS] Well, sometimes. [EOU] But still I think he likes doing it. [EOU] I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way? [EOU] [EOT] Megan [SAYS] Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me. [EOU] [EOT] Roseanne [SAYS] The famous chocolate cookies? [EOU] [EOT] Megan [SAYS] Why not? [EOU] I'm feeling generous today :D [EOU] [EOT] Roseanne [SAYS] Guys, I think I'm gonna change my mind about that beer. [EOU] Meg, would you accept one more helper? [EOU] :D [EOU] [EOT] Megan [SAYS] You're always welcome! [EOU] But sorry boys, it's going to be a “girls only” event (except for little Billy). [EOU] Otherwise my house will never get cleaned today :D [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Lena [SAYS] i told you: no sun and neighbours a bit too close. [EOU] [EOT] Stefy [SAYS] invite them for tea 🤣 [EOU] [EOT] Lena [SAYS] no way, they're too old and very noisy. [EOU] i hope they stop making noise at night. [EOU] [EOT] Stefy [SAYS] you should move away... [EOU] [EOT] Lena [SAYS] it was a mistake to choose this house.

[EOU] [EOT] Sandra [SAYS] What do you think? [EOU] [EOT] Olivia [SAYS] Hm, not sure. [EOU] It sounds really cool, but isn't it dangerous? [EOU] [EOT] Sandra [SAYS] Well, it can be, yes, but I don't think it's much more dangerous than driving a car. [EOU] Accidents happen everywhere. [EOU] I get your point, I was thinking about it as well. [EOU] [EOT] Olivia [SAYS] And? [EOU] Aren't you afraid? [EOU] [EOT] Sandra [SAYS] A bit, yes, but I always wanted to learn horse riding, so I thought that as soon as it isn't anything that requires me to, I don't know, go abroad or a lot of money, I may at least give it a try.

[EOU] [EOT] Max [SAYS] Oh, a Toyota. [EOU] It'll be sooo much more convenient now. [EOU] Our place isn't really that easy to reach by public transport, there's only one bus and it's like the timetable doesn't exist so you often end up waiting at the stop for ages. [EOU] [EOT] George [SAYS] Oh man, I remember it used to be like this. [EOU] I thought things might've changed since the times I used to take the bus to visit you, but I guess not? [EOU] [EOT] Max [SAYS] Yeah, sadly... [EOU] but whatever. [EOU] Now we won't have to rely on them any more, woohoo! [EOU] [EOT] George [SAYS] Must have been hard to convince Sylvia, no? [EOU] [EOT] Max [SAYS] She was against it at first but I knew she had to give in eventually. [EOU] I mean, it'll benefit all of us, after all. [EOU] [EOT] George [SAYS] Man, you'll be so happy, I'm sure. [EOU] I know I don't regret it. [EOU] Nothing beats the comfort and freedom, really. [EOU] [EOT] Max [SAYS] Yeah, I'm trying to convince her to get a licence, too. [EOU] I don't want her to feel like I'm only doing this for myself. [EOU] It would be better if both of us could drive. [EOU] [EOT]

Phillip [SAYS] huh, I've just learned something interesting. [EOU] [EOT] Ronald [SAYS] yeah? [EOU] [EOT] Phillip [SAYS] I got the new laptop cuz my old one couldn't run the newer games [EOU] and I'm downloading something on Steam now [EOU] but I had no idea you didn't have to install games on all computers at home [EOU] turns out you've only gotta download them once and you can just stream them in the same network. [EOU] [EOT] Ronald [SAYS] huh [EOU] that's new to me too, my PC is enough for me so I haven't really looked into it, I guess? [EOU] [EOT] Phillip [SAYS] yeah and apparently this means I could play on my old laptop now too [EOU] because it would be using the new one's resources. [EOU] [EOT] Ronald [SAYS] won't that cause some lag tho? [EOU] I mean, if it's just streaming and you use the old laptop's keyboard and mouse, I guess it still needs to communicate with the other computer [EOU] I wonder how well that works. [EOU] [EOT] Phillip [SAYS] yeah, I probably won't be doing that because there isn't much point, I just thought it was interesting [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] it's really pretty, but I don't think it's worth its price. [EOU] [EOT] Marianne [SAYS] that's why I'm asking you cause I have a dillema. [EOU] [EOT] Cassandre [SAYS] any other suggestions? [EOU] [EOT] Marianne [SAYS] I have 3 options, but this is my favourite and I can easily afford it. [EOU] [EOT] Eveline [SAYS] well, I guess the decision has already been made, buy it then. [EOU] [EOT] Cassandre [SAYS] yeah, I think the same [EOU] [EOT]

Mattie [SAYS] Will you call me when dad is at home? [EOU] [EOT] Ross [SAYS] Sure. [EOU] [EOT] Mattie [SAYS] ty :* [EOU] [EOT]
Oliver [SAYS] I think I should stop reading the rules after we already played a game [EOU] found two things we were doing wrong today. [EOU] [EOT] Chris [SAYS] maybe it shows that you should keep reading them [EOU] so what we were doing wrong? [EOU] [EOT] Oliver [SAYS] first the basic follow-up only gives you temp influence and not the permanent one (so my whole strategy for the day was basically based on a wrong rule :P) [EOU] and second, you only get the income for the resources you own (tokens on top) and not for everything you have access to. [EOU] [EOT] Chris [SAYS] the map had full symbol drawn for the action so I also thought it was permanent influence [EOU] had no idea about the second one. [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] the second rule means money would be much more sparse. [EOU] [EOT] Oliver [SAYS] well yes but it gives you a reason to build an already existing building again [EOU] with the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that. [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] true [EOU] yet another game we need to play again with the right rules ;) [EOU] [EOT] Oliver [SAYS] additionally during the vote phase, if there is a draw the first decision is taken by the player with the least amount of points and not the closest to the player initiating the vote. [EOU] [EOT] Chris [SAYS] makes sense [EOU] but I'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import. [EOU] [EOT] Olivier [SAYS] well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings. [EOU] [EOT] Oliver [SAYS] so no matter how you look at it with import you'll always be on top with your token and get the income. [EOU] [EOT] Chris [SAYS] right [EOU] well just like Emily said we need to play this again. [EOU] [EOT] Emily [SAYS] we can always do it during the next meeting. [EOU] [EOT] Oliver [SAYS] as usual I'm up for anything [EOU] but if we'll play a new game, let me read the rules first :P [EOU] [EOT]
Misha [SAYS] Have you bought from this website? [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] [EOT] Kamil [SAYS] No... [EOU] it looks like a Chinese website. [EOU] [EOT] Pedro [SAYS] I've never heard of it. [EOU] [EOT] Misha [SAYS] I want to buy this dress [EOU] <file_photo> [EOU] It looks great [EOU] But I'm not sure about the quality... [EOU] [EOT] Kamil [SAYS] I wouldn't expect too much... [EOU] [EOT] Pedro [SAYS] Why don't you check opinions on YT? [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] look at that [EOU] It looks like a review of your dress. [EOU] [EOT] Misha [SAYS] Indeed thanks :*  [EOU] [EOT]
Amanda [SAYS] oh no, my phone charger has stopped working. [EOU] [EOT] Keith [SAYS] the cable or the charger itself? [EOU] [EOT] Amanda [SAYS] dunno, it just won't charge. [EOU] [EOT] Keith [SAYS] can't you ask your sister to lend you hers? [EOU] [EOT] Amanda [SAYS] but I have an iphone and she has a samsung. [EOU] [EOT] Keith [SAYS] hmm, yeah, but the charger itself should be the same. [EOU] so if you use your cable with her charger, you could see if it works? [EOU] then at least you'll know which part needs replacing. [EOU] [EOT] Amanda [SAYS] oh, I could do that, yeah [EOU] should I get the spare part from apple or...? [EOU] [EOT] Keith [SAYS] idk, I've never had an iphone. [EOU] I hear not all cables are compatible for some reason but imo you should be able to find a cheaper replacement that should work... [EOU] their prices are too high. [EOU] [EOT] Amanda [SAYS] uhh... [EOU] alright, I guess checking what's wrong comes first. [EOU] [EOT] Keith [SAYS] can you do it now? [EOU] [EOT] Amanda [SAYS] yeah, I'll brb. [EOU] [EOT] Keith [SAYS] k. [EOU] [EOT] Amanda [SAYS] back [EOU] and it's still not charging :( [EOU] [EOT] Keith [SAYS] then it must be the cable. [EOU] or... [EOU] [EOT] Amanda [SAYS] or?? [EOU] there's another possibility? [EOU] [EOT] Keith [SAYS] well, I guess there might be sth wrong with the charging port but that's the worst case scenario [EOU] so let's not think about it yet? [EOU] [EOT] Amanda [SAYS] I'm a bit worried now but ok :( [EOU] [EOT] Keith [SAYS] I've found some shop that sells replacement cables [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] I'd try this one first, see if the phone detects the cable at all [EOU] cuz if it does, then problem solved, if it doesn't... [EOU] then it might be the port [EOU] but it's cheap enough to give it a try. [EOU] [EOT] Amanda [SAYS] thanks, I'll do that... [EOU] I hope it'll work, not sure if I can afford a repair :/ [EOU] [EOT]
Mateo [SAYS] Duuude pick up ur phone or open the door. [EOU] [EOT] Jesse [SAYS] its 5am in the morning theres a reason i did not answer the phone -_- [EOU] [EOT] Mateo [SAYS] i just need something.

Fran [SAYS] so how's the new affair going?;) [EOU] [EOT] Sally [SAYS] hmm. [EOU] [EOT] Fran [SAYS] what happened? [EOU] [EOT] Sally [SAYS] I'm not sure. [EOU] I mean everything is fine but there's no chemistry. [EOU] Maybe there's something wrong with me. [EOU] [EOT] Fran [SAYS] There's nothing wrong with you. [EOU] Don't let yourself think that. [EOU] Maybe you just need more time. [EOU] [EOT] Sally [SAYS] It's not like I wanna give up but sometimes I wonder if I should be forcing myself. [EOU] [EOT] Fran [SAYS] Definitely not. [EOU] But maybe try not to put so much pressure on it. [EOU] [EOT] Sally [SAYS] I just don't understand it. [EOU] And myself. [EOU] [EOT] Fran [SAYS] You don't have to understand anything :) [EOU] [EOT] Sally [SAYS] I mean there was definitely a spark at the beginning and now I really don't know what happened and how to get it back. [EOU] [EOT] Fran [SAYS] You probably started thinking too much ;) [EOU] [EOT] Sally [SAYS] Hahah probably. [EOU] My head is my worst enemy. [EOU] [EOT] Fran [SAYS] You just met, don't force it. [EOU] Why would you want chemistry that just dies out after 3 months? [EOU] Maybe deep down you're looking for something more serious or stable and that's why you actually don't wanna rush it? [EOU] And you're older now. [EOU] It's more difficult to fall madly in love when you are not so easily fooled anymore ;) [EOU] [EOT] Sally [SAYS] I get it. [EOU] It's not even about falling in love. [EOU] I just don't get what happened. [EOU] I mean I can't be in a relationship with absolutely no chemistry at all. [EOU] [EOT] Fran [SAYS] Well it went away so maybe it will come back :D You can't overthink those things. [EOU] They don't like it ;) [EOU] [EOT] Sally [SAYS] I probably am overthinking. [EOU] We had a heart to heart and I feel much better after the talk. [EOU] [EOT] Fran [SAYS] You want soulmates, intellectual connection, and chemistry - that's some high expectations for a new relation. [EOU] Not everything at once. [EOU] [EOT] Sally [SAYS] Yeah I would but I know I can't have it all. [EOU] [EOT] Fran [SAYS] Of course you can. [EOU] But some things work better overtime. [EOU] On the other hand, do NOT force yourself into anything. [EOU] [EOT] Sally [SAYS] I'm not going to. [EOU] I guess I've been lucky I found someone who is understanding and wants to discuss things. [EOU] [EOT] Fran [SAYS] Exactly. [EOU] And once you feel safer, chemistry might come back, because you won't be analyzing and thinking and worrying and pressuring yourself ;) [EOU] [EOT] Sally [SAYS] You're probably right. [EOU] [EOT]
Lizzy [SAYS] can i ask you something? [EOU] [EOT] Sia [SAYS] ask. [EOU] [EOT] Lizzy [SAYS] i'm going out with Marco and his friends [EOU] we will be in a club [EOU] and i need a make up inspiration. [EOU] [EOT] Sia [SAYS] what will you wear? [EOU] [EOT] Lizzy [SAYS] black dress. [EOU] [EOT] Sia [SAYS] so maybe classic smoky? [EOU] [EOT] Lizzy [SAYS] boring. [EOU] [EOT] Sia [SAYS] smoky with colour accent? [EOU] [EOT] Lizzy [SAYS] i was thinking about half cut crease. [EOU] [EOT] Sia [SAYS] hmm, maybe [EOU] have you done any before? [EOU] [EOT] Lizzy [SAYS] no.. [EOU] [EOT] Sia [SAYS] so maybe something easier? [EOU] you don't want to screw anything, right? [EOU] [EOT] Lizzy [SAYS] you're right. [EOU] [EOT] Sia [SAYS] so maybe spotlight? [EOU] just blend a few shades of brown and put some metallic shadow in the middle. [EOU] [EOT] Lizzy [SAYS] which colour do you suggest? [EOU] [EOT] Sia [SAYS] you have green eyes, so maybe purple? [EOU] [EOT] Lizzy [SAYS] okay ^^ [EOU] thank you :* [EOU] [EOT] Sia [SAYS] no problem, just remember about blending! [EOU] [EOT]

Patricia [SAYS] Barry!! [EOU] Have you heard the news? [EOU] They released a demo gameplay from Cyberpunk 2077! [EOU] [EOT] Barry [SAYS] What, really? [EOU] Where did you see that? [EOU] [EOT] Patricia [SAYS] <file_video> [EOU] [EOT] Barry [SAYS] Holy shit, that's pretty impressive... [EOU] I was pumped for the game already but now THIS is hype. [EOU] Whoa. [EOU] [EOT] Patricia [SAYS] I know, right! [EOU] I loved Wild Hunt but this is like a completely different level? [EOU] [EOT] Barry [SAYS] It really is. [EOU] I guess we'll see when the game gets released but for once the NPCs seemed like real people, even the crowds. [EOU] They said they'd be working on that and now I'm sold. [EOU] [EOT] Patricia [SAYS] Yeah, they didn't move awkwardly or anything, it really felt like the world was alive. [EOU] I can't wait!! [EOU] [EOT] Barry [SAYS] It's only a shame about the POV... [EOU] [EOT] Patricia [SAYS] You don't like first-person? [EOU] [EOT] Barry [SAYS] Well, I guess it's okay at times but I'd prefer over-the-shoulder. [EOU] They say you can customise everything about your character so I'd kind of like to be able to see my gear because otherwise what's the point. [EOU] [EOT] Patricia [SAYS] Huh... [EOU] I actually haven't played first-person much, but I ended up really enjoying it in Morrowind. [EOU] It felt really immersive and when I switched to third-person view for a moment, it felt strange. [EOU] [EOT] Barry [SAYS] Well, I'll still be hoping for an option to switch to third-person... [EOU] [EOT] Patricia [SAYS] I wouldn't really count on that. [EOU] They seem really committed to their vision and think this is the best choice so people can enjoy the world 100%. [EOU] [EOT] Barry [SAYS] I'm still not sure but y'know, not gonna hate until it's actually release. [EOU] It looks really good so far so I'd be happy if they proved me wrong and made me enjoy the POV. [EOU] [EOT] Patricia [SAYS] I just wish they'd tell us the release date already! [EOU] [EOT] Barry [SAYS] Hmm, who knows... [EOU] I think it was supposed to be ready this year, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed. [EOU] [EOT]
Anthony [SAYS] Hi Mia! [EOU] How is the birthday girl? [EOU] [EOT] Mia [SAYS] old, man, I feel old...

[EOU] [EOT] Mia [SAYS] Hahaha, where did you read that? [EOU] :D [EOU] [EOT] Anthony [SAYS] I'd rather not say. [EOU] [EOT] Mia [SAYS] <3 [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Jenny [SAYS] great, he asked us multiple times to call him. [EOU] [EOT] Colin [SAYS] I've been very busy recently. [EOU] [EOT] Jenny [SAYS] everybody is busy, but then you complain that you're afraid he want to get rid of us. [EOU] [EOT] Sean [SAYS] I can call him now. [EOU] [EOT] Jenny [SAYS] now it's too late. [EOU] [EOT] Sean [SAYS] it's 10.30 [EOU] [EOT] Jenny [SAYS] I think you shouldn't call people after 10PM. [EOU] [EOT] Colin [SAYS] I agree on this. [EOU] [EOT] Sean [SAYS] So I'll call him tomorrow morning [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] :D [EOU] [EOT] Matty [SAYS] I'm good thank you just sleepy haha :) how about you? [EOU] How's things going with studying. [EOU] [EOT] Ella [SAYS] Oh dear :P What have you been up to? [EOU] ;) I'm not that sleepy, even though I did get to bed late :P [EOU] Uni's hard work (no changes there), but I really like my subjects this semester - on of my subjects is Microbiology (so all on bacteria), another is on the Biochemical Pathways to Metabolic Illnesses (basically diabetes and obesity) - so, pretty cool stuff :D [EOU] WHat about you? [EOU] Are you having fun? [EOU] [EOT] Matty [SAYS] Sounds interesting I've gotta say. [EOU] Particularly the bacteria stuff! [EOU] I've been on a walk today so quite tired from that. [EOU] And I'm enjoying uni yeah! [EOU] Very very busy. [EOU] Starting dissertation stuff soon and had a lot of work for essays. [EOU] [EOT] Ella [SAYS] Did you take any photos whilst on your walk? [EOU] :D So... [EOU] what does your dissertation stuff look like? [EOU] Are you in any Uni groups? [EOU] [EOT] Matty [SAYS] Got some yeah :) posted one to Facebook. [EOU] Mine is looking like geography and politics related. [EOU] Not sure about uni groups? [EOU] What's your dissertation on if you have to do one? [EOU] [EOT] Ella [SAYS] We don't really have dissertations... [EOU] at the end of my third year I'll be writing my degree, so that will be like a slightly longer lab report :) Geography and politics - hmmm... [EOU] that's a pretty wide topic, I mean, you could talk about Global warming etc. [EOU] right? [EOU] [EOT] Matty [SAYS] Aah ok. [EOU] So the long report is a big part of your degree and counts a lot towards it? [EOU] And it's very wide the topic. [EOU] Can talk about that yes, can also do social and cultural stuff too in there. [EOU] [EOT] Ella [SAYS] Yeah, basically my grades and my report make up my degree :) Social and cultural stuff... [EOU] like what? [EOU] [EOT] Matty [SAYS] Aaah cool :D I have exams too which make mine up haha. [EOU] Lucky you [EOU] And stuff like social separation and classes and how everything plays into each other and culture is like heritage and what matters to different people. [EOU] [EOT] Ella [SAYS] I meant grades from exams, so I don't know if I'm really that lucky :P That's actually really interesting! [EOU] So how do you prepare for this? [EOU] Do you get to interview people? [EOU] [EOT] Matty [SAYS] Oh right haha. [EOU] And I have to do loads of reading and prepare some fieldwork. [EOU] And I likely will have to inerview people yeah. [EOU] What kind of things do you do in the lab? [EOU] [EOT] Ella [SAYS] Depends on your field of study - I'm doing Embriology, so I basically conduct experiments on mouse oocytes that should hopefully give some decent results. [EOU] But other people can grow bacteria on petri dishes if they're doing Microbiology, or study particular fragments of DNA if they're doing Genetics [EOU] It really depends on what you're studying - Biology has a pretty large spectrum, afterall :) [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Julie [SAYS] Oh, the Santa Clause films, right, I think there are three or four? [EOU] [EOT] Ramsay [SAYS] Yes, I forget how many. [EOU] [EOT] Julie [SAYS] This is a good start.

[EOU] I didn't take it as I don't need it and I don't want it, but it was never a problem to get one. [EOU] [EOT] Anne [SAYS] See, that's what everyone's telling me, I don't get HSBC's policy.

[EOU] [EOT] Chay [SAYS] Any particular carpet? [EOU] [EOT] Anna [SAYS] No, just my carpet, pretty much anywhere in the house. [EOU] [EOT] Chay [SAYS] Colour/texture/cleanliness? [EOU] anything in particular? [EOU] [EOT] Anna [SAYS] all of the above. [EOU] [EOT] Chay [SAYS] Gosh, you sound fed up indeed. [EOU] What are you going to do about this? [EOU] Move out? [EOU] Replace carpets? [EOU] [EOT] Anna [SAYS] I was thinking I could maybe drink a lot of wine and then I won't be fed up anymore. [EOU] [EOT] Chay [SAYS] That could work. [EOU] Definitely cheapest option. [EOU] Do you need help? [EOU] drinking? [EOU] [EOT] Anna [SAYS] Always! [EOU] Bring some wine! [EOU] [EOT] Chay [SAYS] Was this a really cunning trick to make me come over with wine? [EOU] [EOT] Anna [SAYS] Yeah I can't be bothered to go to the shop and need an excuse! [EOU] [EOT] Chay [SAYS] Chapeau! [EOU] <file_GIF> [EOU] [EOT]
Michaela [SAYS] So what do you guys think about the association idea? [EOU] [EOT] Ron [SAYS] I might be lacking the context here. [EOU] [EOT] Michaela [SAYS] Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example. [EOU] [EOT] Jessie [SAYS] I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork. [EOU] [EOT] Steve [SAYS] And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year. [EOU] [EOT] Michaela [SAYS] These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. [EOU] Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? [EOU] Doesn't have to be one person. [EOU] [EOT] Steve [SAYS] Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility. [EOU] [EOT] Ron [SAYS] The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? [EOU] There are also some financial costs, are there? [EOU] [EOT] Michaela [SAYS] yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really. [EOU] [EOT] Jessie [SAYS] so what do we get from it really? [EOU] [EOT] Michaela [SAYS] maybe the cost of a rubber stamp. [EOU] for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other> [EOU] [EOT] Ron [SAYS] and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association. [EOU] [EOT] Jessie [SAYS] I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually. [EOU] [EOT] Michaela [SAYS] I recall two as well. [EOU] [EOT] Steve [SAYS] but do we truly need those subsidies? [EOU] We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort. [EOU] I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. [EOU] I've seen it happen to clubs like ours. [EOU] [EOT] Ron [SAYS] it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding. [EOU] [EOT] Michaela [SAYS] association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. [EOU] It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association. [EOU] [EOT] Jessie [SAYS] well... [EOU] I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. [EOU] I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work. [EOU] [EOT] Michaela [SAYS] as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly. [EOU] [EOT] Ron [SAYS] I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it. [EOU] [EOT] Michaela [SAYS] Steve? [EOU] [EOT] Steve [SAYS] I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now. [EOU] [EOT] Michaela [SAYS] Ok, maybe it's better to talk about this in person. [EOU] Is Monday after the meeting ok for you all? [EOU] [EOT] Steve [SAYS] yup, I can stay a bit longer. [EOU] [EOT] Jessie [SAYS] Fine by me. [EOU] [EOT] Ron [SAYS] as well [EOU] [EOT]
Amy [SAYS] What is important in life? [EOU] [EOT] Laura [SAYS] Sex and money.

[EOU] [EOT] Laura [SAYS] Naah, love makes you suffer [EOU] I don’t want to suffer anymore. [EOU] I want to be a rich bitch who gets amazing orgasms for breakfast. [EOU]  [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] I’ve never seen Angela so happy. [EOU] [EOT] Stephanie [SAYS] Nice. [EOU] And how about the father? [EOU] Does she have a good relationship with him?

[EOU] [EOT] Bruce [SAYS] Ah :( [EOU] That's so stupid, really, coz where are you supposed to get experience if everyone wants you to have experience already. [EOU] [EOT] Debra [SAYS] Yeah... [EOU] Mum isn't in the best shape either, dad's death really took a toll on her and she's not young any more, so I don't know if she'll be able to find anything [EOU] Sometimes everything feels really hopeless... [EOU] Sorry, I'm not the best person to talk to these days. [EOU] [EOT] Bruce [SAYS] What are you talking about?? [EOU] It's fine, I know you've been going through a rough patch [EOU] I wrote coz I really wanted to know how you've been, you don't have to force yourself to act happy. [EOU] [EOT] Debra [SAYS] Thanks, Bruce [EOU] I'm not sure I can express how much I appreciate the fact that you're here for me. [EOU] [EOT] Bruce [SAYS] Don't mention it. [EOU] [EOT] Debra [SAYS] No, it's a big thing to me... [EOU] Actually, not too many people have talked to me recently, so I was a little lonely [EOU] I think I might cry, I'm sorry. [EOU] [EOT] Bruce [SAYS] Oh no, please don't cry :( I'm here. [EOU] [EOT] Debra [SAYS] I know... [EOU] it's not entirely bad tears, it's also because I'm happy I have you [EOU] I'm just kind of emotional. [EOU] [EOT] Bruce [SAYS] /hug. [EOU] [EOT] Debra [SAYS] Thank you, really. [EOU] [EOT] Bruce [SAYS] You know you can call me any time, don't you. [EOU] [EOT] Debra [SAYS] Yeah... [EOU] I think I should eat something...

[EOU] It's my aunt's funeral. [EOU] [EOT] April [SAYS] I'm sorry to hear it. [EOU] [EOT] Archibald [SAYS] Well, not really my aunt. [EOU] Just a friend of the family. [EOU] [EOT] April [SAYS] I understand. [EOU] Were u close? [EOU] [EOT] Archibald [SAYS] No. [EOU] I saw her once every two or three years. [EOU] But she was close with my father and I'm taking him to the funeral. [EOU] [EOT] April [SAYS] I see. [EOU] [EOT] Archibald [SAYS] What time did you plan to go biking?

Jody [SAYS] I hate ironing! [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] Me too! [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] Especially shirts! [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] I know, that's a pain in the neck! [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] My hubby uses like 5 shirts a week! [EOU] And all I do is iron them! [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] Can't he do it himself? [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] Wouldn't even let him near an iron! [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] Why not? [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] Well, mostly because the last time he did ironing, he burnt my favourite shirt and two of his own. [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] How did he manage to do that? [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] Have no idea. [EOU] Suppose he left the iron on the shirts and forgot to unplug it, but will never know. [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] Have you tried an ironing machine? [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] Yes, I have an iron at home. [EOU] Don't need to borrow it from the neighbour. [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] No, like this: <file_other> [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] What's this? [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] An ironing machine. [EOU] Useful with shirts, T-shirts and similar. [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] So, how does it work? [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] Not sure. [EOU] Probably hot air goes through and pushes the material out so that it also irons it. [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] Sounds too good to be true. [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] But it isn't! [EOU] I have a similar one and it actually works! [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] Rly? [EOU] Can I come over someday and judge for myself? [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] Sure! [EOU] I'm doing the laundry tonight. [EOU] If you have time tomorrow, pop in for a quick coffee ;) [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] Sure will! [EOU] Thanks! [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] No problem! [EOU] Hope it makes your life easier :) [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] If it works as advertised, surely will! [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] Believe me! [EOU] It does! [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] Tomorrow around 2:00? [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] Sure. [EOU] Will be waiting. [EOU] [EOT] Jody [SAYS] See you then. [EOU] [EOT] Lynn [SAYS] Bye. [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Carol [SAYS] really? [EOU] i thought you'd never done it. [EOU] [EOT] Harvey [SAYS] i grew up in the snow and used to ski all the time [EOU] i also used to play hockey and skate.

Jan [SAYS] Guys... [EOU] the landlord has just published her review of us. [EOU] It's I-N-S-A-N-E <file_photo> [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] Give me a sec. [EOU] [EOT] Ricardo [SAYS] FUCK. [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] I especially like the bit about Janek being "sombre" and "exceptionally rude" [EOU] [EOT] Jan [SAYS] omg was I? [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] Hmmmm well, I bet it's one of these cultural differences... [EOU] As a Spaniard she probably expected you to become her best friend and have a friendly chat about the weather... [EOU] Instead, you greeted her enumerating all the faults of the apartment (which I would also do, but I understand if it was too much for her). [EOU] [EOT] Jan [SAYS] Well then, I'll write to her and apologise, perhaps she'll change the review? [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] I doubt it, but you can try if you have a moment to spare. [EOU] Again, I don't really think you've done anything wrong, but upon some consideration, she might have misunderstood our non-Spanish behaviour. [EOU] [EOT] Jan [SAYS] Yeah, I think you're right. [EOU] Also, I assume this thing about cigarette fags all over the balcony is yet another delusion of hers? [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] Fuuuck. [EOU] I actually might have left some... [EOU] I was so tired in the morning I didn't even think about that. [EOU] I'm so sorry guys 😭 [EOU] [EOT] Jan [SAYS] Well, it looks like we deserve the shitty review and there's not much we can do about it, can we? [EOU] [EOT] Ricardo [SAYS] Hmmm, yeah, you might be right. [EOU] In any case it's only one negative review by a silly old woman, I don't really think it'll ruin our lives. [EOU] [EOT] Jan [SAYS] I feel like it'll totally ruin mine 💩 [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] Change your name to Juan as I've been suggesting for years. [EOU] [EOT] Jan [SAYS] 😂 [EOU] [EOT] Ricardo [SAYS] When life gives you lemons, change your name to Juan. [EOU] [EOT] Emma [SAYS] And your life will be much fun lalalalaaaa 🎵 [EOU] [EOT] Jan [SAYS] AAAAAAAAAAAA 🙉🙉🙉 [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Kim [SAYS] she said that she saw beheaded bodies and it did not "faze her at all" [EOU] [EOT] Elena [SAYS] insane [EOU] although I'm very sorry reading the story how her children died of malnutrition. [EOU] [EOT] Kim [SAYS] but if she had stayed in the UK, her children wouldn't have had suffer this fate. [EOU] [EOT] Elena [SAYS] it's a good point [EOU] she brought it upon herself.

[EOU] [EOT] Meg [SAYS] No, marketing department at a publishing house giving out materials for teachers. [EOU] It wouldn't be any progress for me. [EOU] It'd a step back in fact.

Leu [SAYS] How are you? [EOU] Any new development about the house? [EOU] [EOT] Luisa [SAYS] Hello my dear! [EOU] Sadly not. [EOU] No news at all regarding the house :(( We'll be sitting on it till the end of our lives! [EOU] [EOT] Leu [SAYS] That can't be. [EOU] It is such a fantastic property. [EOU] In such an incredibly beautiful estate. [EOU] It's a matter of time. [EOU] [EOT] Luisa [SAYS] That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market. [EOU] [EOT] Leu [SAYS] It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland. [EOU] [EOT] Luisa [SAYS] Oh well... [EOU] Wait and see. [EOU] The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. [EOU] They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. [EOU] And that was it. [EOU] She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. [EOU] Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night. [EOU] [EOT] Leu [SAYS] He does it from time to time, doesn't he? [EOU] [EOT] Luisa [SAYS] From time to time? [EOU] Regularly!!! [EOU] Can't you remember?! [EOU] [EOT] Leu [SAYS] Not quite. [EOU] Never saw him really tight. [EOU] [EOT] Luisa [SAYS] Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. [EOU] I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. [EOU] It's just every day that he tipples. [EOU] [EOT] Leu [SAYS] As if slowly killing himself with liquor. [EOU] [EOT] Luisa [SAYS] He doesn't care. [EOU] He says he's got his life behind him. [EOU] [EOT] Leu [SAYS] But it is terrible. [EOU] How can you cope with it? [EOU] [EOT] Luisa [SAYS] I stopped to care too. [EOU] It is his life. [EOU] If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. [EOU] Look I cannot do anything about it. [EOU] What hide bottles? [EOU] Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day. [EOU] [EOT] Leu [SAYS] Therapy? [EOU] [EOT] Luisa [SAYS] Gimme a break! [EOU] Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! [EOU] I can't. [EOU] [EOT] Leu [SAYS] Nor can I. [EOU] [EOT] Luisa [SAYS] We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. [EOU] When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. [EOU] But then it was worse and worse... [EOU] Now it's too late. [EOU] [EOT] Leu [SAYS] Poor Luisa, poor Bill. [EOU] It is so sad. [EOU] But you are tough Luisa. [EOU] You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say. [EOU] [EOT] Luisa [SAYS] Yes, I am. [EOU] That keeps me sane. [EOU] I don't worry if I can't change it. [EOU] To a degree... [EOU] [EOT] Leu [SAYS] Right you are! [EOU] "The beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different." Do you remember? [EOU] [EOT] Luisa [SAYS] "Then the rocks are laid bare as the tide pulls away the sand. [EOU] Such is life." [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Lillianne [SAYS] He only met her a few times and already gave her a super expensive gift. [EOU] [EOT] Alan [SAYS] What??? [EOU] [EOT] Lillianne [SAYS] He has money and he compensates other things like that [EOU] But deep inside he’s very insecure. [EOU] [EOT] Alan [SAYS] That’s not a good start of any relationship [EOU] Maybe you should talk to him. [EOU] [EOT] Lillianne [SAYS] I tried but he’s so sensitive [EOU] It’s hard to tell him anything without hurting him [EOU] [EOT]

Steve [SAYS] hi, what do you think about this display? [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] hi! [EOU] let me check [EOU] never had the chance to use it personally but the parameters looks fine [EOU] just remember that if you have a GeForce card it will not work with FreeSync. [EOU] [EOT] Steve [SAYS] is that a problem? [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] it will work as a display, you just won't be able to activate this technology [EOU] I did found something more worrying [EOU] there's lots of reviews about frequent bad pixels in this model and issues with the power supply. [EOU] [EOT] Steve [SAYS] ok, thanks for the info [EOU] I found another one [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] the reviews for this one look much better and the parameters are similar to the previous one [EOU] the only reported issue are faded colors but that's always a subjective matter [EOU] from those two I would definitely choose the second one. [EOU] [EOT] Steve [SAYS] ok, great :) [EOU] I'll order it. [EOU] [EOT] Bill [SAYS] I don't remember what card you have at the moment [EOU] so just make sure you'll be able to connect it properly.

[EOU] [EOT] Jaimie [SAYS] IMO it's not even pizza anymore. [EOU] It's more like a pie. [EOU] [EOT] Clive [SAYS] Hey, Jaimie, I remember you ordering Hawaiian pizza :P. [EOU] [EOT] Jaimie [SAYS] Yup, I'm fine with pineapple, maybe even some cranberry, but only if there's also enough cheese and meat to counterbalance it. [EOU] Who the hell makes sweet pizza?

[EOU] [EOT] Steven [SAYS] Nope, Mum can hear us there, she won't hear us on Facebook! [EOU] [EOT] Harry [SAYS] Unless she just steals your phone... [EOU] [EOT] Lesley [SAYS] Hey, let's just get it over with, okay? [EOU] [EOT] Steven [SAYS] See, that's the spirit! [EOU] [EOT] Harry [SAYS] Dad, Lesley simply has basketball in two hours and wants you to give her a lift :P. [EOU] [EOT] Lesley [SAYS] You little snitch! [EOU] [EOT] Steven [SAYS] Calm down, kids, no one leaves this house until we decide what to get Mum on her birthday. [EOU] [EOT] Lesley [SAYS] But Dad! [EOU] [EOT] Steven [SAYS] Don't “Dad” me. [EOU] Think! [EOU] [EOT] Margaret [SAYS] No worries, your awesome big sister is here :D Mum was interested in this food processor: <file_other> [EOU] [EOT] Harry [SAYS] You want to buy Mum a kitchen appliance? [EOU] [EOT] Steven [SAYS] What's wrong with that? [EOU] Last Christmas I got her an iron. [EOU] [EOT] Lesley [SAYS] Yeah, a great way to suggest her we see her as our servant :P. [EOU] [EOT] Margaret [SAYS] Hey, that was mean! [EOU] [EOT] Harry [SAYS] Any other ideas? [EOU] [EOT] Lesley [SAYS] What about a spa break? [EOU] [EOT] Steven [SAYS] I like the idea. [EOU] But isn't it too expensive? [EOU] [EOT] Margaret [SAYS] No, actually prices are quite varied, depending on what exactly is included in the offer. [EOU] Give me a sec. [EOU] [EOT] Harry [SAYS] Are we giving her mud baths? [EOU] XD. [EOU] [EOT] Margaret [SAYS] Moron. [EOU] [EOT] Steven [SAYS] Maggie, don't be mean to your brother. [EOU] [EOT] Margaret [SAYS] OK, OK. [EOU] Look at this offer <file_other>. [EOU] Or this one <file_other>. [EOU] [EOT] Lesley [SAYS] I like the second one better. [EOU] [EOT] Steven [SAYS] I have no idea what all these things even mean, so I'll have to trust you on this one, girls. [EOU] [EOT] Harry [SAYS] What, no mud baths?! [EOU] [EOT] Steven [SAYS] Harold, one more word and you'll be washing my car tonight. [EOU] And there's a lot of mud on it. [EOU] [EOT] Margaret [SAYS] Okay, the second one then. [EOU] If no one objects, I'll take care of it. [EOU] Just give me the money :D [EOU] [EOT]
Max [SAYS] Din anyone actually watch this the video? [EOU] <link_video> [EOU] [EOT] Allen [SAYS] Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. [EOU] But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. [EOU] But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases. [EOU] [EOT] Jeremy [SAYS] Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an "occasional low cumulative", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month. [EOU] [EOT] Max [SAYS] Tom You didn’t watch the video. [EOU] [EOT] Tom [SAYS] I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. [EOU] Thanks. [EOU] ;) [EOU] [EOT] Jason [SAYS] I like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody I know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well. [EOU] [EOT] Daniel [SAYS] Short attention span 😊 [EOU] [EOT] Max [SAYS] Daniel probably from pot 🤷‍♂️ [EOU] Jason he does - rewatch the end man. [EOU] He doesn’t specifically say combing the two , but he says one usually precedes the other. [EOU] [EOT] David [SAYS] Jason, I used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer, and I know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco. [EOU] [EOT] Rawiri [SAYS] Jason Hollis yuck...why even??? [EOU] [EOT] Tom [SAYS] I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint? [EOU] [EOT] David [SAYS] I don’t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). [EOU] I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. [EOU] Some spliffs may be big some joints be small... [EOU] [EOT] Ken [SAYS] Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues. [EOU] [EOT] Tom [SAYS] BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. [EOU] Propaganda. [EOU] Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine. [EOU] [EOT] Brian [SAYS] this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. [EOU] It's not saying cannabis is harmful... [EOU] there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates. [EOU] [EOT] Ken [SAYS] Really? [EOU] Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. [EOU] oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it. [EOU] [EOT] Mark [SAYS] Cannabis does not have a bad affect on the lungs!! [EOU] [EOT] Virginia [SAYS] MJ users will not believe anything bad. [EOU] They think it is right up there with kale and swiss chard! [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Dylan [SAYS] thanks! [EOU] :) [EOU] i'm not even gonna deny it... [EOU] i do look great :D [EOU] [EOT] Natalie [SAYS] was it expensive? [EOU] [EOT] Dylan [SAYS] not really considering that the barber not only took care of my hair and beard, but also removed my unibrow and hair on my nose. [EOU] [EOT] Natalie [SAYS] hmm, could you try to convince Ian to go to a barber? [EOU] maybe he'd give it a go, if he saw the effect [EOU] i want him to get rid of his unibrow so bad... [EOU] [EOT] Dylan [SAYS] i haven't notice, that he has one. [EOU] [EOT] Natalie [SAYS] yes, he does and i absolutely hate it [EOU] so, could you talk to him? [EOU] [EOT] Dylan [SAYS] erm, that would be awkward [EOU] 'dude, you need to do something with your eyebrows... [EOU] they look weird...' [EOU] i mean, come on.

[EOU] So we end up fighting the whole time. [EOU] Thought that this is family time thing is supposed to be fun instead it is stressful and annoying. [EOU] Sometimes I think that I'm not cut out for the family life. [EOU] [EOT] George [SAYS] Sounds like you're not really enjoying it. [EOU] I can fully relate. [EOU] This is why I stay single and made sure to get the snip. [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] Don't get me wrong I DO love my kids but all the extra pressure from the wife doesn't help.

Alan [SAYS] Hi there! [EOU] :) [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] Hi, what's up? [EOU] [EOT] Alan [SAYS] Nothing much. [EOU] I've heard you and Tim were apartment hunting the other day :) You guys moving together? [EOU] :) [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] Lol, no :D [EOU] He just lives super close and I thought it was a cool idea to have someone else to go with me :) [EOU] The lady who owns the place actually have us a strange look :) She looked super old fashioned so you know what she must have been thinking :D [EOU] [EOT] Alan [SAYS] Yeah, I can imagine :) [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] And we thought it would be funny not to explain anything. [EOU] But she actually was very polite and never said anything. [EOU] [EOT] Alan [SAYS] That's a good sign actually :) [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] Well, the flat is a typical rental, so she must have seen some stuff :) [EOU] [EOT] Alan [SAYS] Yeah, I can imagine :) [EOU] Anyway, how's the apartment? [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] Well, decent would be the best word to describe it. [EOU] the rooms are old, haven't been renovated in quite some time [EOU] The kitchen is OK - no luxurious stuff but quite nice looking. [EOU] And there is a dishwasher :) [EOU] [EOT] Alan [SAYS] Always a plus - I can't imagine living without one now :) [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] The bathroom has been renovated recently - so it's new and in this kind of rental-basic style [EOU] In general, if I were buying it for myself it would need a serious overhaul, but as a rental should be ok. [EOU] [EOT] Alan [SAYS] So what's stopping you? [EOU] You don't seem all that enthusiastic. [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] The rent is rather high so I would expect a bit more for that money. [EOU] [EOT] Alan [SAYS] Well, then try to negotiate, if she's been renting it already for some time then she knows the game :) You always set the price higher in case you find someone who would be willing to pay it :) [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] Yeah, that's a good idea. [EOU] [EOT] Alan [SAYS] And let me know how it went. [EOU] Would be good to have all the gang closer :) [EOU] [EOT] John [SAYS] yeah, that would be cool :) Will let you know! [EOU]  [EOU] [EOT]

[EOU] [EOT] Gita [SAYS] Yes, Beti is the same, they are still only 4 or 5 after all. [EOU] [EOT] Bev [SAYS] I know, still so young! [EOU] It will help the teachers and TAs anyway, they have a lot to cope with! [EOU] [EOT] Gita [SAYS] I know, I could never do their job! [EOU] I work part time as a music teacher, going round schools. [EOU] [EOT] Bev [SAYS] Oh really? [EOU] I am in Marks, part time too, love it there! [EOU] [EOT] Gita [SAYS] Yes, it really helps to do some sort of work doesn't it! [EOU] I could never manage full time, though. [EOU] [EOT] Bev [SAYS] Oh, I know, Gita. [EOU] My sister's in management and she doesn't see her kids from 6.30am to 6.30pm every day! [EOU] She is a high flier, but she does miss them. [EOU] She does do lots with them on the weekend, though. [EOU] [EOT] Gita [SAYS] Yes, but children need time to just be at home and play or just be with family, not galavanting around all the time! [EOU] [EOT] Bev [SAYS] I agree 100%! [EOU] Is Beti looking forward to feeding the lambs and seeing the baby animals on the farm, Milo is very excited. [EOU] [EOT] Gita [SAYS] Oh yes! [EOU] She loves animals, we have a few pets at home. [EOU] [EOT] Bev [SAYS] Well, we only have fish, they are pretty but not very interesting! [EOU] [EOT] Gita [SAYS] Suppose you're right! [EOU] What time do we have to be at school on Wednesday? [EOU] [EOT] Bev [SAYS] Quite early, I think about 7.45, the bus leaves at 8 and we get to Holly Farm about 10, I think. [EOU] [EOT] Gita [SAYS] Hope the rain keeps off, especially if it's outdoors. [EOU] I'll check their website. [EOU] [EOT] Bev [SAYS] Yes, good idea. [EOU] Anyway, see you Weds, Gita! [EOU] [EOT] Gita [SAYS] Bye, Bev! [EOU] [EOT]

Paige [SAYS] I asked them to wait and send the declaration later [EOU] Even end of March if it's possible. [EOU] [EOT] Maddy [SAYS] What did they say? [EOU] [EOT] Paige [SAYS] They want to close it asap cause Lisa is afraid she forgets about it later [EOU] But I can remind her in a couple of weeks [EOU] It's my responsibility after all. [EOU] [EOT] Maddy [SAYS] But does it really matter? [EOU] I mean the declaration [EOU] I think the deadline for payment is 31 March anyway. [EOU] [EOT] Paige [SAYS] I'm not sure, that's what I asked her [EOU] Hope she confirms [EOU] [EOT]
