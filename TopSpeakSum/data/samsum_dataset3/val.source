A [SAYS] Hi Tom, are you busy tomorrow’s afternoon? [EOU] B [SAYS] I’m pretty sure I am. [EOU] What’s up? [EOU] A [SAYS] Can you go with me to the animal shelter?. [EOU] B [SAYS] What do you want to do? [EOU] A [SAYS] I want to get a puppy for my son. [EOU] B [SAYS] That will make him so happy. [EOU] A [SAYS] Yeah, we’ve discussed it many times. [EOU] I think he’s ready now. [EOU] B [SAYS] That’s good. [EOU] Raising a dog is a tough issue. [EOU] Like having a baby ;-) [EOU] A [SAYS] I'll get him one of those little dogs. [EOU] B [SAYS] One that won't grow up too big;-) [EOU] A [SAYS] And eat too much;-)) [EOU] B [SAYS] Do you know which one he would like? [EOU] A [SAYS] Oh, yes, I took him there last Monday. [EOU] He showed me one that he really liked. [EOU] B [SAYS] I bet you had to drag him away. [EOU] A [SAYS] He wanted to take it home right away ;-). [EOU] B [SAYS] I wonder what he'll name it. [EOU] A [SAYS] He said he’d name it after his dead hamster – Lemmy - he's a great Motorhead fan :-))) [EOU]
Emma [SAYS] I’ve just fallen in love with this advent calendar! [EOU] Awesome! [EOU] I wanna one for my kids! [EOU] Rob [SAYS] I used to get one every year as a child! [EOU] Loved them! [EOU] Emma [SAYS] Yeah, i remember! [EOU] they were filled with chocolates! [EOU] Lauren [SAYS] they are different these days! [EOU] much more sophisticated! [EOU] Haha! [EOU] Rob [SAYS] yeah, they can be fabric/ wooden, shop bought/ homemade, filled with various stuff. [EOU] Emma [SAYS] what do you fit inside? [EOU] Lauren [SAYS] small toys, Christmas decorations, creative stuff, hair bands & clips, stickers, pencils & rubbers, small puzzles, sweets. [EOU] Emma [SAYS] WOW! [EOU] That’s brill! [EOU] X. [EOU] Lauren [SAYS] i add one more very special thing as well- little notes asking my children to do something nice for someone else. [EOU] Rob [SAYS] i like that! [EOU] My sister adds notes asking her kids questions about christmas such as What did the 3 wise men bring? [EOU] etc. [EOU] Lauren [SAYS] i reckon it prepares them for Christmas. [EOU] Emma [SAYS] and makes it more about traditions and being kind to other people. [EOU] Lauren [SAYS] my children get very excited every time they get one! [EOU] Emma [SAYS] i can see why! [EOU] :) [EOU]
Jackie [SAYS] Madison is pregnant [EOU] but she doesn't wanna talk about it. [EOU] Iggy [SAYS] why. [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] I don't know why because she doesn't wanna talk about it. [EOU] Iggy [SAYS] ok. [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] I wanted to prepare you for it because people get super excited and ask lots of questions [EOU] and she looked way more anxious than excited. [EOU] Iggy [SAYS] she's probably worrying about it [EOU] she's taking every commitment really seriously. [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] it could be money problems or relationship problems. [EOU] Iggy [SAYS] or maybe she wants an abortion. [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] it could be all of the above. [EOU] Iggy [SAYS] but you know what? [EOU] once my friend was pregnant and I couldn't bring myself to be happy about it. [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] why? [EOU] Iggy [SAYS] I felt they were immature and I couldn't picture this couple as parents. [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] I felt similar way on Patricia's wedding. [EOU] Iggy [SAYS] Patricia Stevens? [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] yes. [EOU] Iggy [SAYS] so we're talking about the same person. [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] what a coincidence [EOU] so she's pregnant? [EOU] Iggy [SAYS] she thought she was. [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] damn... [EOU]
Marla [SAYS] <file_photo> [EOU] look what I found under my bed. [EOU] Kiki [SAYS] lol. [EOU] Tamara [SAYS] is that someone's underwear? [EOU] Marla [SAYS] it certainly isn't mine, my ass is big but it isn't huge. [EOU] Kiki [SAYS] it looks like male underwear. [EOU] Tamara [SAYS] not necessarily, maybe some butch had fun in your room while you were gone. [EOU] Marla [SAYS] ok but how can you leave your underwear after hooking up? [EOU] wtf is wrong with people. [EOU] Kiki [SAYS] she or he could be too wasted to notice. [EOU] Tamara [SAYS] or maybe someone put their pants there to piss you off. [EOU] Marla [SAYS] that makes no sense [EOU] it's so fucking childish. [EOU] Kiki [SAYS] if it's childish then it must have been your sister's idea. [EOU] Marla [SAYS] she's 13, she doesn't have underwear that isn't pink. [EOU] Tamara [SAYS] maybe it belonged to one of your exes? [EOU] Kiki [SAYS] she would have recognized it. [EOU] Marla [SAYS] lol we're doing total CSI investigation on one pair of boxers :D [EOU] Kiki [SAYS] <file_gif> [EOU] Tamara [SAYS] lol [EOU] I think your sister convinced someone to put their underwear in your room as a dare. [EOU] Marla [SAYS] sounds legit. [EOU] Kiki [SAYS] Tamara, you just cracked the case! [EOU] Tamara [SAYS] <file_gif> [EOU] always happy to help [EOU]

Carmen [SAYS] How is Martha? [EOU] Has anyone visited her? [EOU] Diego [SAYS] Last week. [EOU] She'll stay in the hospital another few weeks. [EOU] Marcel [SAYS] I want to go on Monday. [EOU] Carmen [SAYS] Few more weeks, it doesn't sound good. [EOU] Diego [SAYS] I think it's not that bad [EOU] But she needs to stay under observation. [EOU] Carmen [SAYS] So the baby is not in danger anymore. [EOU] Diego [SAYS] From what I understood all is under control. [EOU] Marcel [SAYS] Maybe she'll have to stay there until the end of her pregnancy. [EOU] Carmen [SAYS] She's already 30 weeks pregnant. [EOU] Maybe it's better that she stays under doctors' control [EOU] In case something happens [EOU] But it must be tough to stay in the hospital bed all these weeks [EOU]

Camil [SAYS] ok guys, so I've made this group so that everyone can share their opinion about the bowling on Friday. [EOU] When it comes to hours, I suggest 8pm, the price is 5$ per person. [EOU] Luna [SAYS] is 8pm the only option? [EOU] I'm at work until 7:30 and it's possible I won't make it on time. [EOU] Jannet [SAYS] I'm open to any suggestions, 8pm sounds ok. [EOU] Camil [SAYS] it's not the only option, we can also go at 9pm or even later. [EOU] Luna [SAYS] Cool, then I'd opt for 9pm. [EOU] Joseph [SAYS] I'm of the same opinion as Jannet. [EOU] Jannet [SAYS] how about having a before party? [EOU] Mick [SAYS] hey guys!!! [EOU] I'm totally in. [EOU] Camil [SAYS] Before party is a must :D we can meet at my place at 7pm or something. [EOU] Luna [SAYS] so sad I won't be there :/ [EOU] Camil [SAYS] Don't worry, after party was also included in the plan :p. [EOU] Luna [SAYS] happy to hear that :D [EOU] Joseph [SAYS] do we need to take our shoes or something? [EOU] Jannet [SAYS] only if you want to, they have special shoes at the bowling club. [EOU] Joseph [SAYS] hm....I guess I'll take mine afterall. [EOU] Camil [SAYS] I guess it's all settled then, we're in touch, if you have any questions you can either text me or call me. [EOU] Joseph [SAYS] yep :D [EOU] Luna [SAYS] Sure [EOU]

[EOU] Ikea has got exact same desk as my architect put in the project, so it's super convenient. [EOU] James [SAYS] No room for spontanous choice though :( [EOU] Harry [SAYS] Seriously, I hate having too much to choose from. [EOU] I have problems to decide then. [EOU] James [SAYS] I get you man.

[EOU] Edd [SAYS] well, it's quite official [EOU] Anderson just told us. [EOU] Rose [SAYS] and do you know what it changes for us? [EOU] Edd [SAYS] they won't change the professors [EOU] but i know the paperwork will get trickier. [EOU] Rose [SAYS] and i guess that is a move that is supposed to make everything easier. [EOU] Edd [SAYS] yeah, guess so [EOU] they have a funny way of understanding 'to make things easier' [EOU]

[EOU] Thea [SAYS] How dare she come to your house and criticise you like that [EOU] And speaking with the others in Armenian, that's so impolite when she thinks you don't understand. [EOU]

Kirk [SAYS] So they've just decided to move the capital. [EOU] Jenny [SAYS] how silly, they think they will escape the problems this way? [EOU] Abdi [SAYS] seems so. [EOU] Marvin [SAYS] I've never been to Gitega, seems a shithole :P. [EOU] Abdi [SAYS] it's 20 or so times smaller than Bujumbura. [EOU] Marvin [SAYS] exactly. [EOU] Kirk [SAYS] and the costs it will generate. [EOU] Abdi [SAYS] but it will take some time. [EOU] Kirk [SAYS] they say about 3 years. [EOU] Jenny [SAYS] anyway, Nkurunziza promised it in 2007, didn't he? [EOU] Kirk [SAYS] he did [EOU] I think something similar was made in Birma at some point by the regime there [EOU] to just avoid protests and clashes. [EOU] Jenny [SAYS] do they have any city planning project for Gitega? [EOU] Kirk [SAYS] I've no idea. [EOU] Marvin [SAYS] So you think it's for political reasons? [EOU] Kirk [SAYS] at least partially. [EOU] Jenny [SAYS] to avoid being toppled by some city unrests in Bujumbura [EOU] there he will have more control over space [EOU]
Arnold [SAYS] <file_other> look what I'm buying for black friday. [EOU] Baldwin [SAYS] no way, do they have more in stock? [EOU] Evelyn [SAYS] I've always wanted some of those curved TVs.

[EOU] Arnold [SAYS] <file_photo> here you go, be quick about it [EOU]
Mike [SAYS] Do you know where Tomas is from? [EOU] Jenny [SAYS] Eastern Europe I believe. [EOU] Mike [SAYS] sure, but what country exactly [EOU] I heard him speaking English today with Kamil, so I think he's not Polish. [EOU] Jack [SAYS] Really? [EOU] I was sure he was Polish. [EOU] Kyle [SAYS] He's from Slovenia. [EOU] Mike [SAYS] oh, how cute, how do you know? [EOU] Kyle [SAYS] We talked many times about Slovenia and his home town. [EOU] Mike [SAYS] Which is? [EOU] Kyle [SAYS] Bled I think, close to the Alps. [EOU] Jack [SAYS] and why do you find Slovenia cute? [EOU] hahaha. [EOU] Mike [SAYS] I think he's the only Slovenian in the company now. [EOU] Jack [SAYS] true, quite exotic [EOU]

Jessy [SAYS] Did you know that Caroline got herself a new car? [EOU] Clara [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] I have seen it the other day but I thought it was a loaner. [EOU] A navy blue right? [EOU] Jessy [SAYS] Yes. [EOU] Dark blue Toyota. [EOU] Clara [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] That's the one I saw. [EOU] It looks brand new. [EOU] Jessy [SAYS] I remember her talking about changing her old Mitsubishi but didn't know she already made that move. [EOU] Clara [SAYS] I guess so. [EOU] Maybe is time we trade in our old friend too. [EOU] Jessy [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] I was thinking about it too. [EOU] But this time I think I would want an SUV. [EOU] They have much more space. [EOU] Clara [SAYS] Do you have any specific brand in mind? [EOU] Jessy [SAYS] I was thinking about Infinity or Toyota too. [EOU] Clara [SAYS] Those are nice cars. [EOU] Maybe we should start looking around. [EOU] Jessy [SAYS] But it definitely is not gonna be a new one. [EOU] Is way too much money for a new one. [EOU] Clara [SAYS] I agree. [EOU]
Emma [SAYS] girls [EOU] I forgot to send you that link [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] Hallie [SAYS] :) [EOU] Emma [SAYS] sorry that it took so long!!

Luigi [SAYS] Geez, Mayweather totally destroyed McGregor! [EOU] Did you watch gentlemen?? [EOU] Lorenzo [SAYS] I'm not very much into boxing, rather prefer MMA but the buzz about this fight made me watch it [EOU] And yeah, the black guy seemed to be only defending himself for a few rounds but at the same time Conor lost much of his stamina. [EOU] Pablo [SAYS] Whatta hell are you two talking about?? [EOU] McGregor and boxing?? [EOU] He's an mma warrior, those R 2 different worlds! [EOU] Wtf [EOU] And Mayweather?? [EOU] He's fuckin 40, he's to fuckin old to fight! [EOU] Luigi [SAYS] Hahaha Pablito :D [EOU] You follow UFC events and you know mcgregor's a freak and likes to provoke people. [EOU] Pablo [SAYS] Aight but those R people from mma that he provokes, not from fuckin boxing! [EOU] He's fuckin one unpredictable piece of bastard. [EOU] Lorenzo [SAYS] You better watch your mouth Pablo cause if Conor finds out what you're sayin, you'll be the next xD. [EOU] Pablo [SAYS] Sheit dudes, that's a fuckin nonsense [EOU] But anyway... [EOU] Mayweather won, you've said that. [EOU] And McGregor? [EOU] Was he sharp? [EOU] Luigi [SAYS] He was, actually I was surprised cause he was fighting pretty well for 5 maybe 6 rounds [EOU] Floyd had to keep his guard up and seemed to have little chances cuz the Irishman was attacking again an again [EOU] But you know, Floyd is an old bird and all this time he was waiting for Conor to get tired and you know the rest :) [EOU] Pablo [SAYS] Experience bitch, he beat 'The Notorious' thanks to his fuckin experience! [EOU] Luigi [SAYS] No doubt about it, bro. [EOU] Lorenzo [SAYS] But you know, Mcgregor's never fought 10 rounds, in MMA 3 rounds is the limit. [EOU] Pablo [SAYS] True. [EOU] Lorenzo [SAYS] So what if they agreed for a rematch on the mma rules?? [EOU] :) [EOU] Pablo [SAYS] Duuuuuude [EOU] Conor would destroy him, no doubt. [EOU] Luigi [SAYS] Who knows, maybe they've been planning two differnt fights, who knows :) [EOU] Pablo [SAYS] Hope so, I'm goin to fuckin wait for the fight even if it would be at 4 am. [EOU] Lorenzo [SAYS] Good old Pablo... [EOU] I love your temperament you son of a bitch. [EOU] Pablo [SAYS] Yeah, you're not the first bitch to say that. [EOU] Luigi [SAYS] Lol xD [EOU]
Emily [SAYS] Hi, so what do u think about the change of ENG teachers? [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] Hi, well I must admit that I was quite surprised. [EOU] I don't really understand why we weren't informed b4 March break. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] I think they didn't want us 2 panic during our holidays. [EOU] The school was closed 4 2wks so no one would be available to deal with our Qs & concerns. [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] You might be right. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] And I'm sure the new teacher is highly qualified. [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] Yeah, she has an MA in education & she's a native Canadian speaker. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] Oh, I didn't know that. [EOU] So she will teach our kids a true & correct accent :) [EOU] Sophie [SAYS] Annie seems to already like her. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] Jenny is also happy. [EOU] She says that the classes are very fun & interesting. [EOU]
Tim [SAYS] Ready? [EOU] Joan [SAYS] No, no yet, stop pushing me! [EOU] Tim [SAYS] I'm just asking, calm down! [EOU] Joan [SAYS] Sorry, sorry, I'm just too nervous. [EOU]  [EOU]
Monica [SAYS] Should we take the shuttle bus at 2? [EOU] Rachel [SAYS] Why 2? [EOU] Monica [SAYS] To avoid being late? [EOU] Rachel [SAYS] LOL. [EOU] The lecture is at 5pm. [EOU] Monica [SAYS] Hmm, too early? [EOU] Rachel [SAYS] I think it's pointless to be there 3 hours earlier. [EOU] Monica [SAYS] So what? [EOU] the next shuttle is at 5.30 [EOU] Rachel [SAYS] We can just take a public bus at about 4 [EOU] Monica [SAYS] ok, as you prefer! [EOU]  [EOU]

Kyle [SAYS] Who wants to go out for a drink? [EOU] Megan [SAYS] No, sorry, I'm cleaning the house today. [EOU] Roseanne [SAYS] You've always loved cleaning, haven't you? [EOU] I remember how angry you used to get with your brother for leaving a mess in the kitchen. [EOU] Vince [SAYS] Yeah, she'd always yell at me, even though I was the one in charge when our parents were away. [EOU] Kyle [SAYS] I don't get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. [EOU] No one died from a bit of dust. [EOU] Megan [SAYS] Remind me to never stay at your place :P. [EOU] Roseanne [SAYS] I'm somewhere in between. [EOU] My house is always a mess, but I hate it when it's dirty. [EOU] Vince [SAYS] What's the difference? [EOU] Roseanne [SAYS] I can't stand when there's dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so I clean regularly. [EOU] But I love it when all my stuff just lies around. [EOU] When I put everything back on shelves or into cabinets, I keep on getting mad that I have to look for it, get up and take it out, and generally lose so much time. [EOU] I like to have everything within my reach. [EOU] Vince [SAYS] There's no better wardrobe than the armchair, right? [EOU] XD. [EOU] Kyle [SAYS] I prefer the floor. [EOU] There's more space on it :D [EOU] Megan [SAYS] Just reading this gives me the creeps. [EOU] Kyle [SAYS] Fine, go back to cleaning, we'll think of you while sharing a beer :D [EOU] Roseanne [SAYS] Hey, I never said I can come. [EOU] My hubby's away this weekend, so I have no one to leave the kids with ;( [EOU] Vince [SAYS] Take them to Megan's place, they can help her clean :D [EOU] Megan [SAYS] You know what? [EOU] I don't care. [EOU] I can watch your kids, Roseanne. [EOU] Just bring them over. [EOU] Roseanne [SAYS] But are you serious or just mad at us? [EOU] Megan [SAYS] No, I'm serious. [EOU] I like your kids. [EOU] And they're nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it :D [EOU] Roseanne [SAYS] LOL, okay. [EOU] Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun. [EOU] Vince [SAYS] And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? [EOU] :D [EOU] Roseanne [SAYS] Exactly. [EOU] But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. [EOU] They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job. [EOU] Kyle [SAYS] Do they pay him? [EOU] :P. [EOU] Roseanne [SAYS] Well, sometimes. [EOU] But still I think he likes doing it. [EOU] I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way? [EOU] Megan [SAYS] Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me. [EOU] Roseanne [SAYS] The famous chocolate cookies? [EOU] Megan [SAYS] Why not?

[EOU] Sandra [SAYS] Well, it can be, yes, but I don't think it's much more dangerous than driving a car. [EOU] Accidents happen everywhere. [EOU] I get your point, I was thinking about it as well. [EOU] Olivia [SAYS] And? [EOU] Aren't you afraid? [EOU] Sandra [SAYS] A bit, yes, but I always wanted to learn horse riding, so I thought that as soon as it isn't anything that requires me to, I don't know, go abroad or a lot of money, I may at least give it a try.

[EOU] Olivia [SAYS] I feel I'm going to regret it, but ok :P How much is it? [EOU] Sandra [SAYS] 20 quid per hour, you spend there always more around two, but pay only for the riding part. [EOU]

[EOU] Max [SAYS] Oh, a Toyota. [EOU] It'll be sooo much more convenient now. [EOU] Our place isn't really that easy to reach by public transport, there's only one bus and it's like the timetable doesn't exist so you often end up waiting at the stop for ages. [EOU] George [SAYS] Oh man, I remember it used to be like this. [EOU] I thought things might've changed since the times I used to take the bus to visit you, but I guess not? [EOU] Max [SAYS] Yeah, sadly... [EOU] but whatever. [EOU] Now we won't have to rely on them any more, woohoo! [EOU] George [SAYS] Must have been hard to convince Sylvia, no? [EOU] Max [SAYS] She was against it at first but I knew she had to give in eventually. [EOU] I mean, it'll benefit all of us, after all. [EOU] George [SAYS] Man, you'll be so happy, I'm sure. [EOU] I know I don't regret it. [EOU] Nothing beats the comfort and freedom, really. [EOU] Max [SAYS] Yeah, I'm trying to convince her to get a licence, too. [EOU] I don't want her to feel like I'm only doing this for myself. [EOU] It would be better if both of us could drive. [EOU]

Erica [SAYS] that Paul is a smart guy, isn't he? [EOU] Rachel [SAYS] he is at the top of his class. [EOU] Erica [SAYS] I'm having trouble in calculus 101, I wonder if he could tutor me. [EOU] Rachel [SAYS] I can ask him for you. [EOU] Erica [SAYS] I don't want to give him the wrong idea, though. [EOU] Rachel [SAYS] the wrong idea? [EOU] what do you mean? [EOU] Erica [SAYS] I don't want him to think I want to date or anything lol. [EOU] Rachel [SAYS] lol i see what you mean [EOU] some guys are cocky like that :-/ [EOU] Erica [SAYS] I KNOW!! [EOU] The only thing I want from him is to learn what derivatives are lol XD. [EOU] Rachel [SAYS] lol, I don't think he'd get the wrong idea if you were upfront about it [EOU] just tell him you're having trouble and need help. [EOU] Period. [EOU] Nothing more. [EOU] Erica [SAYS] mmm I'm too shy to ask him to tutor me [EOU] maybe I'll just ask the professor for extra credit. [EOU] Rachel [SAYS] don't do that! [EOU] you just need a bit of help. [EOU] Erica [SAYS] you know what, i'll start a study group. [EOU] Rachel [SAYS] that's a great idea!!!

Harry [SAYS] <file_photo> [EOU] That feeling, when you wash your car by yourself working your ass off half of a day [EOU] You feel satisfaction looking at your shining beauty [EOU] And then a group of birds having their fucking convention on electrical cable above, decide to shit on your freshly washed car [EOU] Ruthless fuckers. [EOU] Pete [SAYS] Hahahha. [EOU] Congrats mate. [EOU] Don't worry. [EOU] When my father washes his car, evertime he's done with it, it starts raining. [EOU] The birds though.... [EOU] Coid blooded fuckers. [EOU] Harry [SAYS] I feel like shooting them, but I know I would feel totally bad hurting even one of these animals. [EOU] Pete [SAYS] Sympathetic sadist :D Nice combo there :D [EOU] Harry [SAYS] Hahaha. [EOU]
Phillip [SAYS] huh, I've just learned something interesting. [EOU] Ronald [SAYS] yeah? [EOU] Phillip [SAYS] I got the new laptop cuz my old one couldn't run the newer games [EOU] and I'm downloading something on Steam now [EOU] but I had no idea you didn't have to install games on all computers at home [EOU] turns out you've only gotta download them once and you can just stream them in the same network. [EOU] Ronald [SAYS] huh [EOU] that's new to me too, my PC is enough for me so I haven't really looked into it, I guess? [EOU] Phillip [SAYS] yeah and apparently this means I could play on my old laptop now too [EOU] because it would be using the new one's resources. [EOU] Ronald [SAYS] won't that cause some lag tho? [EOU] I mean, if it's just streaming and you use the old laptop's keyboard and mouse, I guess it still needs to communicate with the other computer [EOU] I wonder how well that works. [EOU] Phillip [SAYS] yeah, I probably won't be doing that because there isn't much point, I just thought it was interesting [EOU]
Martha [SAYS] hey [EOU] can you do something for me? [EOU] Agnes [SAYS] naturally [EOU] what do you need? [EOU] Martha [SAYS] can you please prepare your famous soup for the party? [EOU] Agnes [SAYS] oh [EOU] ofc  [EOU]

[EOU] Eveline [SAYS] it's really nice, how much is it? [EOU] Cause I don't see any price. [EOU] Marianne [SAYS] 100$ [EOU] Cassandre [SAYS] hm....I guess that's a rather regular price for such an occasion. [EOU] Eveline [SAYS] 100$? [EOU] really? [EOU] it's really pretty, but I don't think it's worth its price. [EOU] Marianne [SAYS] that's why I'm asking you cause I have a dillema. [EOU] Cassandre [SAYS] any other suggestions? [EOU] Marianne [SAYS] I have 3 options, but this is my favourite and I can easily afford it. [EOU] Eveline [SAYS] well, I guess the decision has already been made, buy it then. [EOU] Cassandre [SAYS] yeah, I think the same [EOU]

Oliver [SAYS] I think I should stop reading the rules after we already played a game [EOU] found two things we were doing wrong today. [EOU] Chris [SAYS] maybe it shows that you should keep reading them [EOU] so what we were doing wrong? [EOU] Oliver [SAYS] first the basic follow-up only gives you temp influence and not the permanent one (so my whole strategy for the day was basically based on a wrong rule :P) [EOU] and second, you only get the income for the resources you own (tokens on top) and not for everything you have access to. [EOU] Chris [SAYS] the map had full symbol drawn for the action so I also thought it was permanent influence [EOU] had no idea about the second one. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] the second rule means money would be much more sparse. [EOU] Oliver [SAYS] well yes but it gives you a reason to build an already existing building again [EOU] with the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] true [EOU] yet another game we need to play again with the right rules ;) [EOU] Oliver [SAYS] additionally during the vote phase, if there is a draw the first decision is taken by the player with the least amount of points and not the closest to the player initiating the vote. [EOU] Chris [SAYS] makes sense [EOU] but I'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import. [EOU] Olivier [SAYS] well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings. [EOU] Oliver [SAYS] so no matter how you look at it with import you'll always be on top with your token and get the income. [EOU] Chris [SAYS] right [EOU] well just like Emily said we need to play this again. [EOU] Emily [SAYS] we can always do it during the next meeting. [EOU] Oliver [SAYS] as usual I'm up for anything [EOU] but if we'll play a new game, let me read the rules first :P [EOU]
Misha [SAYS] Have you bought from this website? [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] Kamil [SAYS] No... [EOU] it looks like a Chinese website. [EOU] Pedro [SAYS] I've never heard of it. [EOU] Misha [SAYS] I want to buy this dress [EOU] <file_photo> [EOU] It looks great [EOU] But I'm not sure about the quality... [EOU] Kamil [SAYS] I wouldn't expect too much... [EOU] Pedro [SAYS] Why don't you check opinions on YT? [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] look at that [EOU] It looks like a review of your dress. [EOU] Misha [SAYS] Indeed thanks :*  [EOU]
Amanda [SAYS] oh no, my phone charger has stopped working. [EOU] Keith [SAYS] the cable or the charger itself? [EOU] Amanda [SAYS] dunno, it just won't charge. [EOU] Keith [SAYS] can't you ask your sister to lend you hers? [EOU] Amanda [SAYS] but I have an iphone and she has a samsung. [EOU] Keith [SAYS] hmm, yeah, but the charger itself should be the same. [EOU] so if you use your cable with her charger, you could see if it works? [EOU] then at least you'll know which part needs replacing. [EOU] Amanda [SAYS] oh, I could do that, yeah [EOU] should I get the spare part from apple or...? [EOU] Keith [SAYS] idk, I've never had an iphone. [EOU] I hear not all cables are compatible for some reason but imo you should be able to find a cheaper replacement that should work... [EOU] their prices are too high. [EOU] Amanda [SAYS] uhh... [EOU] alright, I guess checking what's wrong comes first. [EOU] Keith [SAYS] can you do it now? [EOU] Amanda [SAYS] yeah, I'll brb. [EOU] Keith [SAYS] k. [EOU] Amanda [SAYS] back [EOU] and it's still not charging :( [EOU] Keith [SAYS] then it must be the cable. [EOU] or... [EOU] Amanda [SAYS] or?? [EOU] there's another possibility? [EOU] Keith [SAYS] well, I guess there might be sth wrong with the charging port but that's the worst case scenario [EOU] so let's not think about it yet? [EOU] Amanda [SAYS] I'm a bit worried now but ok :( [EOU] Keith [SAYS] I've found some shop that sells replacement cables [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] I'd try this one first, see if the phone detects the cable at all [EOU] cuz if it does, then problem solved, if it doesn't... [EOU] then it might be the port [EOU] but it's cheap enough to give it a try. [EOU] Amanda [SAYS] thanks, I'll do that... [EOU] I hope it'll work, not sure if I can afford a repair :/ [EOU]
Mateo [SAYS] Duuude pick up ur phone or open the door. [EOU] Jesse [SAYS] its 5am in the morning theres a reason i did not answer the phone -_- [EOU] Mateo [SAYS] i just need something.

[EOU] how long do you have to wait for the results? [EOU] Martin [SAYS] Until Monday, more or less. [EOU] Sarah [SAYS] Ok. [EOU] Martin [SAYS] It was mostly a multiple choice thing but it was still difficult as fuck. [EOU] Sarah [SAYS] What was the name of the subject again? [EOU] Martin [SAYS] 19th Century European History. [EOU] Sarah [SAYS] Ok. [EOU] Martin [SAYS] I almost soiled my pants when I saw the questions. [EOU] Sarah [SAYS] Marty, please... [EOU] gross. [EOU] Martin [SAYS] Gross but honest :P [EOU]

[EOU] Just chilling out with a bit of Apprentice on IPlayer. [EOU] Serena [SAYS] Haven't watched it this year, what are the idiots up to? [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] Ooh, it's excellent this time, lots of bitching, backstabbing and foolish choices, cringy puns too! [EOU] Serena [SAYS] Sounds great, might look it up for a laugh! [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] Yeah, good idea! [EOU] I mean, why did they think that Jetpop would be a good name for an airline, complete with exploding icon for the O in Pop! [EOU] Serena [SAYS] They never did! [EOU] I bet they lost! [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] Yes, they did indeed! [EOU] Then there was the one when they decided that Siracha hot sauce was a good idea on top of doughnuts! [EOU] Serena [SAYS] Oh my God, I've got to see that, it sounds bloody terrible! [EOU] Jackie [SAYS] Better get back to it, anyway! [EOU] Don't overdo it, love! [EOU] Pop into the shop on the weekend to say Hi. [EOU] Serena [SAYS] Will do! [EOU] I need some new jeans anyway.

[EOU] Tyler [SAYS] yeah :D [EOU] Orion [SAYS] you're not actually gonna order it, right? [EOU] Tyler [SAYS] why was i looking for it online then :/ [EOU] Orion [SAYS] are you kidding me. [EOU] Tyler [SAYS] i am not, i like it man. [EOU] Orion [SAYS] okay Nerd! [EOU] Tyler [SAYS] i'm not a nerd. [EOU] Orion [SAYS] actually you are. [EOU] Tyler [SAYS] shut up-_- [EOU] Orion [SAYS] xD [EOU]
Lily [SAYS] Why r u so sad? [EOU] Sandra [SAYS] Something's happened? [EOU] Lily [SAYS] Nope, I just feel a bit low today :( [EOU] Sandra [SAYS] Wanna meet today? [EOU] Lily [SAYS] Sure! [EOU]
Ethan [SAYS] You ready to go? [EOU] Ann [SAYS] Yep. [EOU] Ethan [SAYS] Ok, let's meet next to the bus station, I'll come for you. [EOU] Ann [SAYS] Gr8 :) [EOU] Ethan [SAYS] I will be there within 10min :) So at you house Danny within 20-25min. [EOU] Danny [SAYS] OK [EOU]
Fran [SAYS] so how's the new affair going?;) [EOU] Sally [SAYS] hmm. [EOU] Fran [SAYS] what happened? [EOU] Sally [SAYS] I'm not sure. [EOU] I mean everything is fine but there's no chemistry. [EOU] Maybe there's something wrong with me. [EOU] Fran [SAYS] There's nothing wrong with you. [EOU] Don't let yourself think that. [EOU] Maybe you just need more time. [EOU] Sally [SAYS] It's not like I wanna give up but sometimes I wonder if I should be forcing myself. [EOU] Fran [SAYS] Definitely not. [EOU] But maybe try not to put so much pressure on it. [EOU] Sally [SAYS] I just don't understand it. [EOU] And myself. [EOU] Fran [SAYS] You don't have to understand anything :) [EOU] Sally [SAYS] I mean there was definitely a spark at the beginning and now I really don't know what happened and how to get it back. [EOU] Fran [SAYS] You probably started thinking too much ;) [EOU] Sally [SAYS] Hahah probably. [EOU] My head is my worst enemy. [EOU] Fran [SAYS] You just met, don't force it. [EOU] Why would you want chemistry that just dies out after 3 months? [EOU] Maybe deep down you're looking for something more serious or stable and that's why you actually don't wanna rush it? [EOU] And you're older now. [EOU] It's more difficult to fall madly in love when you are not so easily fooled anymore ;) [EOU] Sally [SAYS] I get it. [EOU] It's not even about falling in love. [EOU] I just don't get what happened. [EOU] I mean I can't be in a relationship with absolutely no chemistry at all. [EOU] Fran [SAYS] Well it went away so maybe it will come back :D You can't overthink those things. [EOU] They don't like it ;) [EOU] Sally [SAYS] I probably am overthinking. [EOU] We had a heart to heart and I feel much better after the talk. [EOU] Fran [SAYS] You want soulmates, intellectual connection, and chemistry - that's some high expectations for a new relation. [EOU] Not everything at once. [EOU] Sally [SAYS] Yeah I would but I know I can't have it all. [EOU] Fran [SAYS] Of course you can. [EOU] But some things work better overtime. [EOU] On the other hand, do NOT force yourself into anything. [EOU] Sally [SAYS] I'm not going to. [EOU] I guess I've been lucky I found someone who is understanding and wants to discuss things. [EOU] Fran [SAYS] Exactly. [EOU] And once you feel safer, chemistry might come back, because you won't be analyzing and thinking and worrying and pressuring yourself ;) [EOU] Sally [SAYS] You're probably right. [EOU]
Lizzy [SAYS] can i ask you something? [EOU] Sia [SAYS] ask. [EOU] Lizzy [SAYS] i'm going out with Marco and his friends [EOU] we will be in a club [EOU] and i need a make up inspiration. [EOU] Sia [SAYS] what will you wear? [EOU] Lizzy [SAYS] black dress. [EOU] Sia [SAYS] so maybe classic smoky? [EOU] Lizzy [SAYS] boring. [EOU] Sia [SAYS] smoky with colour accent? [EOU] Lizzy [SAYS] i was thinking about half cut crease. [EOU] Sia [SAYS] hmm, maybe [EOU] have you done any before? [EOU] Lizzy [SAYS] no.. [EOU] Sia [SAYS] so maybe something easier? [EOU] you don't want to screw anything, right? [EOU] Lizzy [SAYS] you're right. [EOU] Sia [SAYS] so maybe spotlight? [EOU] just blend a few shades of brown and put some metallic shadow in the middle. [EOU] Lizzy [SAYS] which colour do you suggest? [EOU] Sia [SAYS] you have green eyes, so maybe purple? [EOU] Lizzy [SAYS] okay ^^ [EOU] thank you :* [EOU] Sia [SAYS] no problem, just remember about blending! [EOU]

[EOU] Betty [SAYS] Not today. [EOU] I'm still working. [EOU] Michael [SAYS] Pity. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] Maybe tomorrow? [EOU] Michael [SAYS] I don't know about tomorrow, cos we're going to install some benches at a school and it might take quite a while. [EOU] Betty [SAYS] I see. [EOU] Michael [SAYS] How about the weekend? [EOU] Betty [SAYS] I'm free on Saturday evening. [EOU] Michael [SAYS] Awsome! [EOU] Saturday 19:00? [EOU] Betty [SAYS] Great! [EOU]  [EOU]
Ashley [SAYS] OMG, did u hear that Karen is on sick leave... [EOU] :/ [EOU] Brianna [SAYS] Are you joking? [EOU] :O Again? [EOU] It's like the 4th time in 3 mths. [EOU] Ashley [SAYS] Yeah & I'm stuck giving the presentation on my own again. [EOU] But u know, she'll take credit 4 it, when she returns. [EOU] Brianna [SAYS] No way, It's so obvious she's faking it... [EOU] You should really talk 2 Leanne about this, it's totally unfair. [EOU]

[EOU] We are fine, thanks. [EOU] And yourself? [EOU] Beryl [SAYS] I'm very well indeed. [EOU] Thank you. [EOU] Any changes in your setup? [EOU] Anton [SAYS] Not really. [EOU] SOS. [EOU] Same Old Soup ;) But we are happy for that. [EOU] Beryl [SAYS] Are you still running your lovely airbnb? [EOU] Anton [SAYS] Oh yes, we are. [EOU] We had a few months off during summer, our summer, but now bookings start flowing in. [EOU] Well... [EOU] Are you planning to visit us? [EOU] You two are always welcome! [EOU] Beryl [SAYS] You caught me here. [EOU] I'm vaguely considering going down to Onrus again, most likely in January. [EOU] What does it look like with vacancies then? [EOU] Anton [SAYS] Perfect! [EOU] Just give me your dates and I'll keep it booked for you. [EOU] Beryl [SAYS] Would you prefer me to do it via airbnb website or just like this directly with you? [EOU] Anton [SAYS] I think it'll be more advantageous for both of us to do it directly. [EOU] Do you know exactly when you'll be coming? [EOU] Beryl [SAYS] Not so much. [EOU] Can I get back to you in 2, 3 days' time? [EOU] Anton [SAYS] ASAP really. [EOU] As I say we've been receiving bookings daily now. [EOU] Beryl [SAYS] Well, no big deal. [EOU] I'll be staying in Cape Town for a longer time and am quite flexible in my dates. [EOU] Anton [SAYS] Will you be coming with Tino, if I may ask? [EOU] Beryl [SAYS] No. [EOU] I am single again. [EOU] Hurray! [EOU] So pls make it single occupancy any week in January, Anton. [EOU] Anton [SAYS] Great! [EOU] 4th till 12th? [EOU] Beryl [SAYS] Very good. [EOU] I'll call you beforehand from Cape Town. [EOU] Greetings to you both! [EOU] Anton [SAYS] Take care! [EOU]
Kate [SAYS] Remember the fortune-teller I told you about? [EOU] I went to see her. [EOU] Frank [SAYS] and are you now afraid to leave your own house? [EOU] Kate [SAYS] No :P. [EOU] Claire [SAYS] Wow, exciting! [EOU] How was it? [EOU] Kate [SAYS] It was weird. [EOU] You know I thought that she may be a crook, but I wanted to try anyway. [EOU] Claire [SAYS] Was it like in the films? [EOU] She knew your name and everything about you when you walked in? [EOU] Kate [SAYS] Hahaha no, we just talked for the most part.

[EOU] Eve [SAYS] oh shut up Trakas - you know as well as I do that she's only doing this to spite me [EOU] it's probably going to turn out to be a paper that needs filing that could have waited till monday... [EOU] or the janitor forgot his keys again and needs someone to let him in. [EOU] Anton [SAYS] Actually... [EOU] I was going to say that I agree with you ;D. [EOU] Eve [SAYS] or what was it last time? [EOU] she needed me to come in to discuss my project, which *again* could have waited [EOU] wait - you do?? [EOU] I thought you were going to say that it's in my head like ast time... [EOU] Anton [SAYS] yeah... [EOU] I'm sorry about that [EOU] You were right - she is being unfairly biased against you. [EOU] Honestly, I think you should report this. [EOU] Eve [SAYS] And say what? [EOU] Oh by the way, my boss made me come on Saturday for a coffee run - does that count as office harrassment? [EOU] Anton [SAYS] Nooo... [EOU] but that paired up with all the other examples AND witnesses like me or Frank, then we might have a solid case on our hands :) Look, it's worth a shot. [EOU] Eve [SAYS] *Sigh* [EOU] If you say so... [EOU] honestly, I'm not convinced. [EOU] So what does Miss Glorious want with me now? [EOU] Anton [SAYS] She didn't say :/ But I can always try to get you out of there if things get rough.

[EOU] Franklin [SAYS] Fraid not, US office hours are crazy, only have 2 days off, not like you lazy teachers! [EOU] Vic [SAYS] I'm not even going to lower myself to respond to that one! [EOU] Any interesting (and desperate!) American women around? [EOU] Franklin [SAYS] One or two. [EOU] There's one in particular, Ellie, works in the same section as me, we've had a couple of dates, nothing serious. [EOU] I mean, the Basingstoke accent is such a turn on, isn't it?! [EOU] Vic [SAYS] Not that I've noticed. [EOU] Well hope it all goes well with you and Ellie. [EOU] Keep in touch, man! [EOU]  [EOU]

[EOU] now I’m just thinking about it. [EOU] Lucy [SAYS] Oh, you know, your mum’s a health nut. [EOU] Peggy [SAYS] Yeah, I know... [EOU] she’s very health conscious. [EOU] Lucy [SAYS] Well, that’s good. [EOU] Sometimes:-) [EOU] Peggy [SAYS] So, maybe I really should do something about it. [EOU] Lucy [SAYS] Well, we can go to the Green Staten park for a walk, like every Saturday, just to move a bit? [EOU] Peggy [SAYS] Well, I don’t know, I’ll think about it. [EOU] It’s getting too cold already... [EOU] Lucy [SAYS] OK, so wait until springtime;-) [EOU] Peggy [SAYS] Don’t be mean, I just don’t want to catch a cold. [EOU] Lucy [SAYS] Put on warm clothes then. [EOU] No excuses. [EOU] See you on Saturday! [EOU] Peggy [SAYS] OK. [EOU]

Raymond [SAYS] mate can you recommend me any notebook under 500 dollars? [EOU] Kane [SAYS] you can't get a good notebook for that price. [EOU] Raymond [SAYS] that's a lot for me... [EOU] and it's just for my parents to use. [EOU] Kane [SAYS] what are they going to use it for? [EOU] Raymond [SAYS] photos, videos etc. [EOU] Kane [SAYS] well in my opinion it won't even play full HD videos well, unless you want to get a used one. [EOU] Raymond [SAYS] i don't, it's supposed to be a gift. [EOU] Kane [SAYS] so maybe if you wait for black friday then you will be able to get some good price. [EOU] Raymond [SAYS] can you help me find something on black friday then? [EOU] Kane [SAYS] sure thing, please remind me next week. [EOU] Raymond [SAYS] thanks! [EOU] talk to you soon then :) [EOU]

Patricia [SAYS] Barry!! [EOU] Have you heard the news? [EOU] They released a demo gameplay from Cyberpunk 2077! [EOU] Barry [SAYS] What, really? [EOU] Where did you see that? [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] <file_video> [EOU] Barry [SAYS] Holy shit, that's pretty impressive... [EOU] I was pumped for the game already but now THIS is hype. [EOU] Whoa. [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] I know, right! [EOU] I loved Wild Hunt but this is like a completely different level? [EOU] Barry [SAYS] It really is. [EOU] I guess we'll see when the game gets released but for once the NPCs seemed like real people, even the crowds. [EOU] They said they'd be working on that and now I'm sold. [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] Yeah, they didn't move awkwardly or anything, it really felt like the world was alive. [EOU] I can't wait!! [EOU] Barry [SAYS] It's only a shame about the POV... [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] You don't like first-person? [EOU] Barry [SAYS] Well, I guess it's okay at times but I'd prefer over-the-shoulder. [EOU] They say you can customise everything about your character so I'd kind of like to be able to see my gear because otherwise what's the point. [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] Huh... [EOU] I actually haven't played first-person much, but I ended up really enjoying it in Morrowind. [EOU] It felt really immersive and when I switched to third-person view for a moment, it felt strange. [EOU] Barry [SAYS] Well, I'll still be hoping for an option to switch to third-person... [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] I wouldn't really count on that. [EOU] They seem really committed to their vision and think this is the best choice so people can enjoy the world 100%. [EOU] Barry [SAYS] I'm still not sure but y'know, not gonna hate until it's actually release. [EOU] It looks really good so far so I'd be happy if they proved me wrong and made me enjoy the POV. [EOU] Patricia [SAYS] I just wish they'd tell us the release date already! [EOU] Barry [SAYS] Hmm, who knows... [EOU] I think it was supposed to be ready this year, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed. [EOU]
Anthony [SAYS] Hi Mia! [EOU] How is the birthday girl? [EOU] Mia [SAYS] old, man, I feel old... [EOU] :( [EOU] Anthony [SAYS] Well I wish you all the happiness in the world and also I've read that women are much happier in their thirties. [EOU] Mia [SAYS] Hahaha, where did you read that? [EOU] :D [EOU] Anthony [SAYS] I'd rather not say. [EOU] Mia [SAYS] <3 [EOU]
Jenny [SAYS] Has anybody talked to the landlord? [EOU] Colin [SAYS] I haven't... [EOU] Sean [SAYS] me neither. [EOU] Josh [SAYS] nope. [EOU] Jenny [SAYS] great, he asked us multiple times to call him. [EOU] Colin [SAYS] I've been very busy recently. [EOU] Jenny [SAYS] everybody is busy, but then you complain that you're afraid he want to get rid of us. [EOU] Sean [SAYS] I can call him now. [EOU] Jenny [SAYS] now it's too late. [EOU] Sean [SAYS] it's 10.30 [EOU] Jenny [SAYS] I think you shouldn't call people after 10PM. [EOU] Colin [SAYS] I agree on this. [EOU] Sean [SAYS] So I'll call him tomorrow morning [EOU]
Mary [SAYS] What would you be cooking today? [EOU] Hudson [SAYS] My mother asked me to bring chicken. [EOU] you? [EOU] Mary [SAYS] Boiled rice. [EOU] Hudson [SAYS] OK then see you at dinner. [EOU] Haha :P  [EOU]

[EOU] I assume, just like any other universities. [EOU] Jason [SAYS] UBC is big. [EOU] I am sure you'll be fine. [EOU] Mila [SAYS] Are you coming to visit? [EOU] Jason [SAYS] I will be in Vancouver in February. [EOU] Mila [SAYS] Let me know when you're here. [EOU] We gotta meet up!

[EOU] Paul [SAYS] I had my doctor's appointment at 9 am. [EOU] I have been feeling some weird stomach pain for the last couple of days. [EOU] Evelina [SAYS] Oh, is no good. [EOU] How come you haven't told me anything? [EOU] Paul [SAYS] Didn't want to worry you. [EOU] Evelina [SAYS] You should have told me. [EOU] I could have helped you with something. [EOU] Paul [SAYS] It was not that bad. [EOU] I have been able to do everything, is just that I was feeling pretty weird. [EOU] And I could not really at anything. [EOU] Evelina [SAYS] And what did the doctor say? [EOU] Paul [SAYS] He said that is probably some indigestion as I don't have any other symptoms. [EOU] No fever, vomitting or anything. [EOU] Evelina [SAYS] Ok, that's good. [EOU] Did he give you any medicine or something? [EOU] Paul [SAYS] He gave me some herbs mix and if that does not help me told me to come back and they will do an ultrasound. [EOU] Evelina [SAYS] Ok. [EOU] Have you already got the medicine?

[EOU] Lewis [SAYS] Don't tell me you've taken up gardening :D [EOU] Barney [SAYS] No, I dropped my mum's favorite orchid and now I have to replant it before she comes back. [EOU] Lewis [SAYS] LOL, you're so clumsy! [EOU] Judith [SAYS] Wait, I'll ask my Mum. [EOU] Lewis [SAYS] You can always say it was the cat's fault :P. [EOU] Barney [SAYS] Then she'll say it was my fault anyway because I let the cat do it. [EOU] Lewis [SAYS] Do you think she won't notice that you replanted it? [EOU] Barney [SAYS] I hope so :D No, but in all seriousness, I hope that if she sees I did all I could to save it, she won't be that mad. [EOU] She got that bloody plant from Dad on their 25th anniversary, it means a lot to her. [EOU] Judith [SAYS] I'm back. [EOU] Barney [SAYS] And? [EOU] Judith [SAYS] Mum says to try at The Home Depot. [EOU] She buys pots for her plants there. [EOU] Barney [SAYS] Thank you! [EOU] I've already ordered an identical pot from Amazon, but I forgot to order that bark too, and now it's too late to buy it online. [EOU] Why can't orchids grow in soil like normal plants? [EOU] Lewis [SAYS] Because they're too fancy for that? [EOU] Barney [SAYS] LOL, right :D Okay, thanks for help, guys. [EOU] And by “guys” I actually mean Judith :P Now I've gotta go to The Home Depot and pray that they have that goddamn bark there... [EOU]

[EOU] Lena [SAYS] Delap-Uliga-Djarrit (DUD [EOU] Wikipedia says Majuro, but that the main urban area is D-U-P [EOU] and if you look at the wikipedia site of D-U-P it says that it is the capital. [EOU] Marco [SAYS] right! [EOU] bizarre. [EOU] Lena [SAYS] <file_other> [EOU] Milena [SAYS] I don't understand it either. [EOU] Kenny [SAYS] to me it seems that Majuro is the atoll where D-U-P is located. [EOU] Milena [SAYS] maybe. [EOU] Kenny [SAYS] but I'm not sure... [EOU]

Matty [SAYS] Happy Christmas!! [EOU] :D hope you're enjoying the festivities. [EOU] Ella [SAYS] Thanks Matty!! [EOU] Merry Christmas to you too ;) How are you??? [EOU] :D [EOU] Matty [SAYS] I'm good thank you just sleepy haha :) how about you? [EOU] How's things going with studying. [EOU] Ella [SAYS] Oh dear :P What have you been up to? [EOU] ;) I'm not that sleepy, even though I did get to bed late :P [EOU] Uni's hard work (no changes there), but I really like my subjects this semester - on of my subjects is Microbiology (so all on bacteria), another is on the Biochemical Pathways to Metabolic Illnesses (basically diabetes and obesity) - so, pretty cool stuff :D [EOU] WHat about you? [EOU] Are you having fun? [EOU] Matty [SAYS] Sounds interesting I've gotta say. [EOU] Particularly the bacteria stuff! [EOU] I've been on a walk today so quite tired from that. [EOU] And I'm enjoying uni yeah! [EOU] Very very busy. [EOU] Starting dissertation stuff soon and had a lot of work for essays. [EOU] Ella [SAYS] Did you take any photos whilst on your walk? [EOU] :D So... [EOU] what does your dissertation stuff look like? [EOU] Are you in any Uni groups? [EOU] Matty [SAYS] Got some yeah :) posted one to Facebook. [EOU] Mine is looking like geography and politics related. [EOU] Not sure about uni groups? [EOU] What's your dissertation on if you have to do one? [EOU] Ella [SAYS] We don't really have dissertations... [EOU] at the end of my third year I'll be writing my degree, so that will be like a slightly longer lab report :) Geography and politics - hmmm... [EOU] that's a pretty wide topic, I mean, you could talk about Global warming etc. [EOU] right? [EOU] Matty [SAYS] Aah ok. [EOU] So the long report is a big part of your degree and counts a lot towards it? [EOU] And it's very wide the topic. [EOU] Can talk about that yes, can also do social and cultural stuff too in there. [EOU] Ella [SAYS] Yeah, basically my grades and my report make up my degree :) Social and cultural stuff... [EOU] like what? [EOU] Matty [SAYS] Aaah cool :D I have exams too which make mine up haha. [EOU] Lucky you [EOU] And stuff like social separation and classes and how everything plays into each other and culture is like heritage and what matters to different people. [EOU] Ella [SAYS] I meant grades from exams, so I don't know if I'm really that lucky :P That's actually really interesting! [EOU] So how do you prepare for this? [EOU] Do you get to interview people? [EOU] Matty [SAYS] Oh right haha. [EOU] And I have to do loads of reading and prepare some fieldwork. [EOU] And I likely will have to inerview people yeah. [EOU] What kind of things do you do in the lab? [EOU] Ella [SAYS] Depends on your field of study - I'm doing Embriology, so I basically conduct experiments on mouse oocytes that should hopefully give some decent results. [EOU] But other people can grow bacteria on petri dishes if they're doing Microbiology, or study particular fragments of DNA if they're doing Genetics [EOU] It really depends on what you're studying - Biology has a pretty large spectrum, afterall :) [EOU]
Andrew [SAYS] Seen this <file_other> [EOU] Scott [SAYS] Is it Matt's moto? [EOU] Wants to sell it? [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] Yup. [EOU] Wonna buy? [EOU] Scott [SAYS] Dreaming of it. [EOU] Have no cash. [EOU]

[EOU] Alex [SAYS] Agreed with inequalities, and 3 months, 1 is to short [EOU]

[EOU] Ramsay [SAYS] Yes, I forget how many. [EOU] Julie [SAYS] This is a good start. [EOU] More than we need probably. [EOU] Any others? [EOU] Ramsay [SAYS] Well, all the old Rankin Bass stop motion ones like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and The Year Without a Santa Claus. [EOU] Julie [SAYS] Those are great for the kids, right? [EOU] Ramsay [SAYS] I kind of like them myself! [EOU] Nostalgia and all that! [EOU] Julie [SAYS] LOL! [EOU] Ramsay [SAYS] I'm sure there are newer ones, I just don't know them. [EOU] Julie [SAYS] I think so too. [EOU] Christmas with the Kranks, I think, was the chick from the Halloween films? [EOU] Ramsay [SAYS] Now you're getting too modern for me! [EOU] Julie [SAYS] Okay, thanks for the advice! [EOU] Ramsay [SAYS] Enjoy! [EOU]

Anne [SAYS] You have an account with Barclays, right? [EOU] Michael [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] Anne [SAYS] Is it ok? [EOU] I'm thinking about changing my bank. [EOU] Michael [SAYS] Where do you have it now? [EOU] Anne [SAYS] HSBC, they were the only one who actually let me open an account when I arrived to the UK. [EOU] It's time for a change, especially after all those scandals. [EOU] Michael [SAYS] I'm quite happy with Barclays, they don't charge me anything, the service is great and I like the staff. [EOU] Anne [SAYS] I wanted to get a credit card, but my request was declined. [EOU] Michael [SAYS] What? [EOU] Really? [EOU] Barclays offered me a credit card after three months, I think. [EOU] I didn't take it as I don't need it and I don't want it, but it was never a problem to get one. [EOU] Anne [SAYS] See, that's what everyone's telling me, I don't get HSBC's policy. [EOU] Michael [SAYS] Don't dwell on it, just close the account and come to Barclays or Nest, I've heard they're ok too [EOU]

[EOU] Wyatt [SAYS] Oh, this doesn't sound good. [EOU] At all. [EOU] Has anyone called the police? [EOU] Mila [SAYS] Not yet. [EOU] I talked to her father and he said that Anna had warned him that she would disappear for a few weeks. [EOU] It turned out that she has some serious health issues and she needed some time alone to figure out, what to do. [EOU] Wyatt [SAYS] Well, then we should respect her wish and leave her alone. [EOU] Mila [SAYS] I'm just afraid she's going to hurt herself. [EOU] She was so depressed, when I saw her for the last time. [EOU] Wyatt [SAYS] If her family is not concerned, then we shouldn't be either. [EOU] Anna must have some hard time, let's give her some space. [EOU] Mila [SAYS] What if she needs support or someone to talk with? [EOU] Wyatt [SAYS] Then she'll call. [EOU]

[EOU] Fala [SAYS] His pangs are sharpy, when you see him you saw them, right? [EOU] I thought it is genetic but it turned out that his other teeth are not in place and he didn't use his fangs [EOU] That's why [EOU] He asked the dentists if there is any other way not to have braces but all of the dentist he met said the same thing [EOU] First braces to support and his teeth in place for 2 and half years [EOU] And after that additionally the other one for 1 and half years [EOU] He said. [EOU] Evline [SAYS] That sounds like long time. [EOU] And it must be uncomfortable. [EOU] Fala [SAYS] That's what I was thinking about.. [EOU] And it costs a lot [EOU] 2000 dollars and + [EOU] Evline [SAYS] Dentists make money everywhere. [EOU] Fala [SAYS] And I became worried about my teeth. [EOU] Evline [SAYS] Your teeth?

[EOU] Fala [SAYS] Cause it is scary [EOU] Mum, you should regularly go to the dentist. [EOU] Evline [SAYS] Well I have not that many days left to live. [EOU] Fala [SAYS] What are you talking about ?

[EOU] Karl [SAYS] I was thinking, that we'll go somewhere this time. [EOU] Sharon [SAYS] Any particular place? [EOU] Karl [SAYS] I was hoping you might come up with something. [EOU] Sharon [SAYS] Indeed. [EOU] I hear they have diamonds on sale this weekend in Dubai. [EOU] What do you say, Karl? [EOU]

Anna [SAYS] I am so fed up with the carpet. [EOU] Chay [SAYS] What happened? [EOU] Anna [SAYS] Nothing much, I am just really fed up with the carpet. [EOU] Chay [SAYS] Any particular carpet? [EOU] Anna [SAYS] No, just my carpet, pretty much anywhere in the house. [EOU] Chay [SAYS] Colour/texture/cleanliness? [EOU] anything in particular? [EOU] Anna [SAYS] all of the above. [EOU] Chay [SAYS] Gosh, you sound fed up indeed. [EOU] What are you going to do about this? [EOU] Move out? [EOU] Replace carpets? [EOU] Anna [SAYS] I was thinking I could maybe drink a lot of wine and then I won't be fed up anymore. [EOU] Chay [SAYS] That could work. [EOU] Definitely cheapest option. [EOU] Do you need help? [EOU] drinking? [EOU] Anna [SAYS] Always! [EOU] Bring some wine! [EOU] Chay [SAYS] Was this a really cunning trick to make me come over with wine? [EOU] Anna [SAYS] Yeah I can't be bothered to go to the shop and need an excuse! [EOU] Chay [SAYS] Chapeau! [EOU] <file_GIF> [EOU]
Michaela [SAYS] So what do you guys think about the association idea? [EOU] Ron [SAYS] I might be lacking the context here. [EOU] Michaela [SAYS] Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example. [EOU] Jessie [SAYS] I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork. [EOU] Steve [SAYS] And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year. [EOU] Michaela [SAYS] These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. [EOU] Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? [EOU] Doesn't have to be one person. [EOU] Steve [SAYS] Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility. [EOU] Ron [SAYS] The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? [EOU] There are also some financial costs, are there? [EOU] Michaela [SAYS] yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really. [EOU] Jessie [SAYS] so what do we get from it really? [EOU] Michaela [SAYS] maybe the cost of a rubber stamp. [EOU] for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other> [EOU] Ron [SAYS] and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association. [EOU] Jessie [SAYS] I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually. [EOU] Michaela [SAYS] I recall two as well. [EOU] Steve [SAYS] but do we truly need those subsidies? [EOU] We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort. [EOU] I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. [EOU] I've seen it happen to clubs like ours. [EOU] Ron [SAYS] it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding. [EOU] Michaela [SAYS] association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. [EOU] It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association. [EOU] Jessie [SAYS] well... [EOU] I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. [EOU] I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work. [EOU] Michaela [SAYS] as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly. [EOU] Ron [SAYS] I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it. [EOU] Michaela [SAYS] Steve? [EOU] Steve [SAYS] I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now. [EOU] Michaela [SAYS] Ok, maybe it's better to talk about this in person. [EOU] Is Monday after the meeting ok for you all? [EOU] Steve [SAYS] yup, I can stay a bit longer. [EOU] Jessie [SAYS] Fine by me. [EOU] Ron [SAYS] as well [EOU]
Amy [SAYS] What is important in life? [EOU] Laura [SAYS] Sex and money. [EOU] Amy [SAYS] If you have money you can always have sex [EOU] I think love is more important [EOU] You cannot buy it. [EOU] Laura [SAYS] Naah, love makes you suffer [EOU] I don’t want to suffer anymore. [EOU] I want to be a rich bitch who gets amazing orgasms for breakfast. [EOU]  [EOU]
Ian [SAYS] Are you in Catania right now? [EOU] John [SAYS] We're both here, in the same house we were last year. [EOU] Johnny [SAYS] lovely as always. [EOU] John [SAYS] nice! [EOU]

[EOU] Annie [SAYS] Oh I dont [EOU] you know what to present? [EOU] Oleg [SAYS] Yeah [EOU] I have that environmental case [EOU] With Ellen Brockovich. [EOU] Annie [SAYS] this is a nice one. [EOU] Paul [SAYS] I don't have a pair either. [EOU] Annie [SAYS] Too late Paul xd [EOU] I will be with you Oleg. [EOU] Oleg [SAYS] Okay. [EOU] Paul [SAYS] ☹️ [EOU]

[EOU] Stephanie [SAYS] Tell me more ;-) [EOU] Helen [SAYS] My mother has all the important information I’m sure she will be happy to share it ;-) [EOU] Stephanie [SAYS] Is it a new love? [EOU] Did she want it? [EOU] Is the father of the baby happy about it? [EOU] Do they want to be together? [EOU] I’m sure your mother doesn’t know the answer to these questions… [EOU] Helen [SAYS] At the beginning it was shocking news but now they are both very happy waiting for the baby. [EOU] I’ve never seen Angela so happy. [EOU] Stephanie [SAYS] Nice. [EOU] And how about the father? [EOU] Does she have a good relationship with him? [EOU] Does she feel that he’s the right guy? [EOU] Helen [SAYS] She never complained. [EOU] And how about you? [EOU] How was your Christmas? [EOU] Do you have any plans for the New Year’s Eve? [EOU]

[EOU] Bruce [SAYS] /hug. [EOU] Debra [SAYS] /hug [EOU] It's just that... [EOU] mum is still unemployed and so am I, I'm trying to find something but it's not that easy [EOU] I have no job experience and they usually want that... [EOU] Bruce [SAYS] Ah :( [EOU] That's so stupid, really, coz where are you supposed to get experience if everyone wants you to have experience already. [EOU] Debra [SAYS] Yeah... [EOU] Mum isn't in the best shape either, dad's death really took a toll on her and she's not young any more, so I don't know if she'll be able to find anything [EOU] Sometimes everything feels really hopeless... [EOU] Sorry, I'm not the best person to talk to these days. [EOU] Bruce [SAYS] What are you talking about?? [EOU] It's fine, I know you've been going through a rough patch [EOU] I wrote coz I really wanted to know how you've been, you don't have to force yourself to act happy. [EOU] Debra [SAYS] Thanks, Bruce [EOU] I'm not sure I can express how much I appreciate the fact that you're here for me. [EOU] Bruce [SAYS] Don't mention it. [EOU] Debra [SAYS] No, it's a big thing to me... [EOU] Actually, not too many people have talked to me recently, so I was a little lonely [EOU] I think I might cry, I'm sorry. [EOU] Bruce [SAYS] Oh no, please don't cry :( I'm here. [EOU] Debra [SAYS] I know... [EOU] it's not entirely bad tears, it's also because I'm happy I have you [EOU] I'm just kind of emotional. [EOU] Bruce [SAYS] /hug. [EOU] Debra [SAYS] Thank you, really. [EOU] Bruce [SAYS] You know you can call me any time, don't you. [EOU] Debra [SAYS] Yeah... [EOU] I think I should eat something... [EOU] thanks for writing to me, I'm feeling a little better now [EOU]

[EOU] Lillian [SAYS] I don't like it at all. [EOU] Amanda [SAYS] But she's a bitch she deserves it. [EOU] Lillian [SAYS] Why? [EOU] Nobody deserves to be exposed like that [EOU] And Thomas?? [EOU] Nobody calls him a bitch [EOU] After all, Thomas is the one who is in a relationship and was caught having sex with her. [EOU] Amanda [SAYS] She seduced him. [EOU] Lillian [SAYS] He should think with his brain and not only with his dick [EOU]

[EOU] April [SAYS] Oh, I'm sorry. [EOU] I didn't know. [EOU] R u ok? [EOU] Archibald [SAYS] Yes, I'm fine. [EOU] It's my aunt's funeral. [EOU] April [SAYS] I'm sorry to hear it. [EOU] Archibald [SAYS] Well, not really my aunt. [EOU] Just a friend of the family. [EOU] April [SAYS] I understand. [EOU] Were u close? [EOU] Archibald [SAYS] No. [EOU] I saw her once every two or three years. [EOU] But she was close with my father and I'm taking him to the funeral. [EOU] April [SAYS] I see.

Jody [SAYS] I hate ironing! [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] Me too! [EOU] Jody [SAYS] Especially shirts! [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] I know, that's a pain in the neck! [EOU] Jody [SAYS] My hubby uses like 5 shirts a week! [EOU] And all I do is iron them! [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] Can't he do it himself? [EOU] Jody [SAYS] Wouldn't even let him near an iron! [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] Why not? [EOU] Jody [SAYS] Well, mostly because the last time he did ironing, he burnt my favourite shirt and two of his own. [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] How did he manage to do that? [EOU] Jody [SAYS] Have no idea. [EOU] Suppose he left the iron on the shirts and forgot to unplug it, but will never know. [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] Have you tried an ironing machine? [EOU] Jody [SAYS] Yes, I have an iron at home. [EOU] Don't need to borrow it from the neighbour. [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] No, like this: <file_other> [EOU] Jody [SAYS] What's this? [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] An ironing machine. [EOU] Useful with shirts, T-shirts and similar. [EOU] Jody [SAYS] So, how does it work? [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] Not sure. [EOU] Probably hot air goes through and pushes the material out so that it also irons it. [EOU] Jody [SAYS] Sounds too good to be true. [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] But it isn't! [EOU] I have a similar one and it actually works! [EOU] Jody [SAYS] Rly? [EOU] Can I come over someday and judge for myself? [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] Sure! [EOU] I'm doing the laundry tonight. [EOU] If you have time tomorrow, pop in for a quick coffee ;) [EOU] Jody [SAYS] Sure will! [EOU] Thanks! [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] No problem! [EOU] Hope it makes your life easier :) [EOU] Jody [SAYS] If it works as advertised, surely will! [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] Believe me! [EOU] It does! [EOU] Jody [SAYS] Tomorrow around 2:00? [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] Sure. [EOU] Will be waiting. [EOU] Jody [SAYS] See you then. [EOU] Lynn [SAYS] Bye. [EOU]

[EOU] Carol [SAYS] that sounds like fun. [EOU] Harvey [SAYS] we can do all that next week! [EOU]
Jan [SAYS] Guys... [EOU] the landlord has just published her review of us. [EOU] It's I-N-S-A-N-E <file_photo> [EOU] Emma [SAYS] Give me a sec. [EOU] Ricardo [SAYS] FUCK. [EOU] Emma [SAYS] I especially like the bit about Janek being "sombre" and "exceptionally rude" [EOU] Jan [SAYS] omg was I? [EOU] Emma [SAYS] Hmmmm well, I bet it's one of these cultural differences... [EOU] As a Spaniard she probably expected you to become her best friend and have a friendly chat about the weather... [EOU] Instead, you greeted her enumerating all the faults of the apartment (which I would also do, but I understand if it was too much for her). [EOU] Jan [SAYS] Well then, I'll write to her and apologise, perhaps she'll change the review? [EOU] Emma [SAYS] I doubt it, but you can try if you have a moment to spare. [EOU] Again, I don't really think you've done anything wrong, but upon some consideration, she might have misunderstood our non-Spanish behaviour. [EOU] Jan [SAYS] Yeah, I think you're right. [EOU] Also, I assume this thing about cigarette fags all over the balcony is yet another delusion of hers? [EOU] Emma [SAYS] Fuuuck. [EOU] I actually might have left some... [EOU] I was so tired in the morning I didn't even think about that. [EOU] I'm so sorry guys 😭 [EOU] Jan [SAYS] Well, it looks like we deserve the shitty review and there's not much we can do about it, can we? [EOU] Ricardo [SAYS] Hmmm, yeah, you might be right. [EOU] In any case it's only one negative review by a silly old woman, I don't really think it'll ruin our lives. [EOU] Jan [SAYS] I feel like it'll totally ruin mine 💩 [EOU] Emma [SAYS] Change your name to Juan as I've been suggesting for years. [EOU] Jan [SAYS] 😂 [EOU] Ricardo [SAYS] When life gives you lemons, change your name to Juan. [EOU] Emma [SAYS] And your life will be much fun lalalalaaaa 🎵 [EOU] Jan [SAYS] AAAAAAAAAAAA 🙉🙉🙉 [EOU]
Jill [SAYS] Did you do your homework for tomorrow? [EOU] Ashley [SAYS] Sure. [EOU] Jill [SAYS] Can I copy it? [EOU] Ashley [SAYS] Y? [EOU] Jill [SAYS] Going out with my parents tonight and won't have time to do it. [EOU] Ashley [SAYS] Sure <file_picture> here's the picture. [EOU]  [EOU]

[EOU] Claire [SAYS] I’m worried they will give a weird subject or that I will be too far away and won’t hear the recording. [EOU] Nate [SAYS] Me too... [EOU] I listened to all the recordings in the book, but I don't think I'm ready. [EOU] Paula [SAYS] You're all ready, just stop panicking. [EOU] Vince [SAYS] I just want it to be over.

[EOU] Olivia [SAYS] He texted me already and wants to meet. [EOU] Carrie [SAYS] He must have liked you then! [EOU] That's good. [EOU] Olivia [SAYS] No if I don't like him... [EOU] And I kind of think I don't. [EOU] He was nice and all, but... [EOU] Carrie [SAYS] You don't fancy him? [EOU] Olivia [SAYS] :( it's so shallow... [EOU] I feel really bad about it. [EOU] Carrie [SAYS] I think you shouldn't - what guy would say the same? [EOU] We both know they wouldn't talk to a girl they don't find pretty so don't beat yourself about it. [EOU] Olivia [SAYS] Thanks dear [EOU] What should I do? [EOU] He asked me out again. [EOU] Carrie [SAYS] I’d give him another chance.

[EOU] Maria [SAYS] It's pointless, tell her we will meet at the restaurant. [EOU] Leo [SAYS] Why? [EOU] Maria [SAYS] I won't go to the library to pick up Nora, from my place it's 30 minutes by car, it's stupid. [EOU] Leo [SAYS] Ok, right. [EOU] So at the restaurant at 8pm? [EOU] Maria [SAYS] Exactly! [EOU]
Andrew [SAYS] You know what? [EOU] My boss is... [EOU] it's beyond words. [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] What happened? [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] She said that a friend of her son's is coming to her son's birthday party. [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] So what? [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] Well, she said that it's a good and democratic thing to invite a boy from a "poor" family to the party. [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] How nice and generous of her... [EOU] sorry, need to puke. [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] But that's not everything, she said that she doesn't want the other boy's mother to prepare a cake or any other food because "she will use low quality products from the supermarket" [EOU] Charlie [SAYS] Jeez, rich people are insane sometimes. [EOU] Andrew [SAYS] Insane indeed... [EOU]
Jim [SAYS] Hi guys, anyone has a CC Adobe account? [EOU] Daniel [SAYS] I think Stella does. [EOU] Stella?

[EOU] Ben [SAYS] I've got a runny nose and my voice isn't well too. [EOU] George [SAYS] You better stay at home. [EOU] Ben [SAYS] But at Saturday is our performance... [EOU] George [SAYS] Don't worry I'll exuse you. [EOU] Ben [SAYS] Don't you think conductor will be angry if I didn't show up? [EOU] George [SAYS] When you're sick you have to stay home [EOU] We need you more at Saturday than tomorrow. [EOU] Ben [SAYS] Okay so tell him I'll be practising at home. [EOU] George [SAYS] Will you be okay until Saturady? [EOU] Ben [SAYS] I'll do everything, I promise [EOU]

Elena [SAYS] Have you read about the British teenager that escaped to Syria in 2015? [EOU] Kim [SAYS] no, but I remember the case. [EOU] Elena [SAYS] <file_other> [EOU] Andreas [SAYS] there was a similar case in Austria at the beginning of the war [EOU] but, honestly, I cannot relate to their problems [EOU] so much naivety and stupidity. [EOU] Jeff [SAYS] So she wants to come back now? [EOU] Elena [SAYS] apparently [EOU] but she also have no regrets. [EOU] Kim [SAYS] I think it's dangerous. [EOU] Elena [SAYS] that's what the ministry replied [EOU] that she's ideologically dangerous and could even radicalise others. [EOU] Kim [SAYS] she said that she saw beheaded bodies and it did not "faze her at all" [EOU] Elena [SAYS] insane [EOU] although I'm very sorry reading the story how her children died of malnutrition. [EOU] Kim [SAYS] but if she had stayed in the UK, her children wouldn't have had suffer this fate. [EOU] Elena [SAYS] it's a good point [EOU] she brought it upon herself. [EOU] Jeff [SAYS] but maybe she has changed her mind, she was only a child when she left. [EOU] Elena [SAYS] also true... [EOU]
Meg [SAYS] So, I've got a new job. [EOU] Al [SAYS] Really?! [EOU] Congratulations! [EOU] Where, what, how? [EOU] Meg [SAYS] But I won't take it. [EOU] Al [SAYS] Ah, why not? [EOU] Is it the one you said they wouldn't give you good money? [EOU] Meg [SAYS] Well, I came to the conclusion that'd be just a short-sighted remedy for my problems. [EOU] I need to keep searching with some plan. [EOU] Al [SAYS] But was it also an interactive agency? [EOU] Meg [SAYS] No, marketing department at a publishing house giving out materials for teachers. [EOU] It wouldn't be any progress for me. [EOU] It'd a step back in fact. [EOU] Al [SAYS] Alright, I see, but are you sure-sure? [EOU] Meg [SAYS] Yes, I am, I need something more challenging, something I really want to do in life. [EOU] Al [SAYS] That's the trickiest part... [EOU]
Diana [SAYS] I heard you had your tooth removed. [EOU] Neal [SAYS] yes, it hurts like hell, btw how do you know? [EOU] Diana [SAYS] Your brother told me that. [EOU] Neal [SAYS] oh...

[EOU] Mom [SAYS] You know what that means. [EOU] Alex [SAYS] I forgot. [EOU] Mom [SAYS] Sunday means we go to church. [EOU] Alex [SAYS] Oh, yeah. [EOU] You bet we go. [EOU] Mom [SAYS] Don’t push it. [EOU] Put on the coat, let’s go. [EOU] Alex [SAYS] But why? [EOU] Mom [SAYS] To show respect to God and others. [EOU] Alex [SAYS] I'm glad Sunday is only once a week. [EOU] Mom [SAYS] I hope God didn't hear that. [EOU] Alex [SAYS] He'll forgive me. [EOU] Mom [SAYS] I know He will;-) [EOU]
Carol [SAYS] where are the car keys? [EOU] Mindy [SAYS] I don't know mom, I didn't drive today. [EOU] Pater [SAYS] damn, I have them with me, forgot to take them out;/ [EOU] Carol [SAYS] very nice... [EOU] ordering dinner tonight then, your cost kiddos [EOU]

[EOU] I can't face the hassle of a hole in the garden... [EOU] Damian [SAYS] clever [EOU] Did you get a good deal from that Jack guy in the end? [EOU] Will [SAYS] yeah he sorted me right out, decent bloke as well. [EOU] Damian [SAYS] can I have his details? [EOU] My parents are wanting to have their garden done. [EOU] Will [SAYS] defo [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] hold on [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] that's the one [EOU] he's best with his mobile. [EOU] Damian [SAYS] Cool I'll pass it on, thanks dude. [EOU] Will [SAYS] no worries [EOU]
Hillary [SAYS] Have you seen the news? [EOU] George [SAYS] Yeah. [EOU] Jerry [SAYS] That's insane [EOU] Incredibly cold. [EOU] Hillary [SAYS] They said over 20 people died so far. [EOU] George [SAYS] As usual in these kind of circumstances [EOU] The most vulnerable people are affected the most. [EOU] Jerry [SAYS] That's so sad. [EOU] Hillary [SAYS] I'm not leaving the house [EOU] I've never experienced so low temperatures. [EOU] George [SAYS] Me neither. [EOU] Jerry [SAYS] Stay warm guys  [EOU]
Pete [SAYS] People are awesome [EOU] I've just watched a youtube vid that shows incredible stunts ppl do [EOU] Free fall, skiing with kite and other frickin' acrobatic stunts. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] Some ppl just luv adrenaline [EOU] But they also need some talent. [EOU] Pete [SAYS] I envy them these abilities and money to accomplish their dreams... [EOU]

[EOU] Reynold [SAYS] Oh I get it now 😆 [EOU] Francis [SAYS] You might know where am I going with this. [EOU] I do most of the work by myself, but I need someone to help me with heating installations. [EOU] Reynold [SAYS] Gas or electric heating systems? [EOU] Francis [SAYS] Gas [EOU] Not for free of course. [EOU] What do you say?

Helena [SAYS] Hi Wanda, how is Uni going? [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] Pretty well, but the deadlines are doing my head in, so much fucking work! [EOU] Helena [SAYS] I see you've started swearing like a typical student! [EOU] My language got really bad last year! [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] Yeah, I remember! [EOU] I was shocked, but everyone does it here! [EOU] Helena [SAYS] Here too, only with Scottish accent as well, it did take me a few months to get used to it! [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] You're a lot braver than me, I only went about 15 miles to Leeds. [EOU] Helena [SAYS] Yep, you didn't move out of West Yorks even! [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] Well, I prefer it! [EOU] I can even go and work in the petrol station till 10pm and pop home on the late train if I want to, saves me food money to have a day or two of home cooking, plus it's a lot nicer. [EOU] Helena [SAYS] I know what you mean! [EOU] I can't be arsed to peel veg and stuff like that, I exist on take aways and convenience micro meals, not good! [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] Have you got I to the famous Scottish deep fried Mars bar craze? [EOU] Helena [SAYS] 🤣I have had one, but Edinburgh is a bit posher than Glasgow where it's more popular. [EOU] Do like square sausage and cloutie dumpling, though! [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] You'll have to initiate me into these delicacies when I come visit. [EOU] Helena [SAYS] You bet! [EOU] When can you make it? [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] Well, I have two days off lectures at the end of next week and I can swap my shifts around if I do it tomorrow. [EOU] I reckon I can train it up next Thurs if that suits you. [EOU] Helena [SAYS] Should be fine! [EOU] I have got lectures Friday mind, you could try a bit of sightseeing, perhaps? [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] I would love to see the Castle and the National Art Gallery, have a wee look round too, hen! [EOU] Helena [SAYS] Don't start trying to act all Scottish, you sassenach! [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] Not sure what that means, but you're a Yorkshire lass too and you do it! [EOU] Helena [SAYS] Yes, but I'm an adopted Scottish person now. [EOU] I'd really like to stay on here, maybe do a PGCE. [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] You a teacher! [EOU] You haven't got the bloody patience to deal with kids all day! [EOU] Helena [SAYS] Maybe, but it's an idea I've been toying with, convey my passion for history to the young! [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] Hopefully, the young will share your enthusiasm! [EOU] Helena [SAYS] Well, we'll see, still got over a year to decide! [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] Think about it carefully, my sister teaches Geography over in Brighouse, as you know. [EOU] She's only been doing it 3 years and she feels burnt out at the end of term! [EOU] Helena [SAYS] Oh yeah, forgot about that! [EOU] Anyway, keep me posted about next weekend, can't wait to see you if you can manage it! [EOU] Wanda [SAYS] Me too, bye Chuck! [EOU] Helena [SAYS] Bye 😗! [EOU]

[EOU] Pam [SAYS] My grandmother was born not far from Minsk. [EOU] Milton [SAYS] So you would do some private research/ [EOU] Pam [SAYS] I guess so. [EOU] Milton [SAYS] Then I would check better on the internet. [EOU] I was there only for 4 days 10 years ago. [EOU] Pam [SAYS] Do you remember any problems? [EOU] Milton [SAYS] Oh yes, it's a very corrupted system that one has to deals with. [EOU] Bribes, strange arrangements, feeling of insecurity. [EOU] Pam [SAYS] Sounds very bad. [EOU] Milton [SAYS] But google it. [EOU] It may have changed since. [EOU] Pam [SAYS] I will. [EOU] Thanks. [EOU] Milton [SAYS] Good luck! [EOU]

Tiffany [SAYS] Who's Elon Musk? [EOU] Blair [SAYS] You know nothin', John Snow. [EOU] Dale [SAYS] Srsly? [EOU] Never heard of him? [EOU] Tiffany [SAYS] Nope, sorry. [EOU] Dale [SAYS] He set up PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX. [EOU] Blair [SAYS] He wants to go to the moon. [EOU] He's creating the first passenger shuttle to the moon. [EOU] Tiffany [SAYS] Rly? [EOU] :) How much is the ticket? [EOU] Dale [SAYS] Depends. [EOU] Currently around $ 35 mil. [EOU] Tiffany [SAYS] What? [EOU] Blair [SAYS] Rly. [EOU] Unfortunately, that kinda cash doesn't fit into my piggy bank. [EOU] Dale [SAYS] Bt the good news is that you'll be able to watch it using VR! [EOU] Tiffany [SAYS] How?! [EOU] Blair [SAYS] Apparently they're going to stream the whole thing in HD via their satellites. [EOU] Tiffany [SAYS] Wow! [EOU] Amazing! [EOU] When? [EOU] Dale [SAYS] No one really knows. [EOU] When they finally build the shuttle and set off, but the date is not known for now. [EOU] Tiffany [SAYS] Shame. [EOU] Maybe until then I'll manage to buy myself this VR headset ;) [EOU] Blair [SAYS] You really should! [EOU] If not for work, you can always use it for pleasure :) [EOU] Dale [SAYS] Just don't play horror games. [EOU] You'll get a heart attack. [EOU] Tiffany [SAYS] Really that scary? [EOU] Dale [SAYS] Tried it once. [EOU] Nevermind the money. [EOU] I'm not doing it again. [EOU] Blair [SAYS] Someone got scared? [EOU] ;) [EOU] Dale [SAYS] But all other games are fine. [EOU] And the experiences are unspeakable! [EOU] Blair [SAYS] I do confirm that. [EOU] When you put on the headset it's a little awkward at first, but when you forget about it, virtual reality becomes reality. [EOU] Tiffany [SAYS] Where can I buy this? [EOU] Dale [SAYS] The easiest way? [EOU] Online. [EOU] Blair [SAYS] Remeber, it's not cheap. [EOU] Dale [SAYS] <file_other> <file_other> <file_other> <file_other> <file_other> There you go. [EOU] Tiffany [SAYS] Cheap is not the word that best describes it. [EOU] Blair [SAYS] But it's worth it ;) [EOU]

[EOU] Do you have anything specific in mind? [EOU] Jeff [SAYS] Well, I remember she mentioned this jewelry producer she likes. [EOU] It's nothing too fancy here <file_other> [EOU] Tom [SAYS] okaay, I guess it's affordable if we split. [EOU] Jeff [SAYS] but I don't know shit about jewelry and there's just so many kinds. [EOU] Tom [SAYS] Lemme ask Rachel, maybe she'll have some ideas. [EOU] Jeff [SAYS] ok. [EOU] Tom [SAYS] So she says she likes the ones with the orchid theme and it might be Kayla's style too.

[EOU] I can buy it, you just pay me back when we meet or sth. [EOU] Tom [SAYS] ok, if they have some sort of extra fast delivery, I'd choose that. [EOU] Jeff [SAYS] may cost more, though. [EOU] Tom [SAYS] I know, but if we've already decided on this, let's make sure it comes on time. [EOU] Jeff [SAYS] fine by me [EOU]

[EOU] Judyta [SAYS] What are you saying?! [EOU] I'm takin' it! [EOU] How much do you want for it? [EOU] Marta [SAYS] I don't want money from you. [EOU] Just come and take it. [EOU] That'll be one less thing in this already full flat. [EOU] Ida [SAYS] So, Judyta, maybe I could pick you up and we'll go to Marta together? [EOU] We could talk about things by the way :) [EOU] Marta [SAYS] Yeah, brilliant idea! [EOU] I want to see both of you here!

Leu [SAYS] How are you? [EOU] Any new development about the house? [EOU] Luisa [SAYS] Hello my dear! [EOU] Sadly not. [EOU] No news at all regarding the house :(( We'll be sitting on it till the end of our lives! [EOU] Leu [SAYS] That can't be. [EOU] It is such a fantastic property. [EOU] In such an incredibly beautiful estate. [EOU] It's a matter of time. [EOU] Luisa [SAYS] That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market. [EOU] Leu [SAYS] It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland. [EOU] Luisa [SAYS] Oh well... [EOU] Wait and see. [EOU] The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. [EOU] They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. [EOU] And that was it. [EOU] She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. [EOU] Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night. [EOU] Leu [SAYS] He does it from time to time, doesn't he? [EOU] Luisa [SAYS] From time to time? [EOU] Regularly!!! [EOU] Can't you remember?! [EOU] Leu [SAYS] Not quite. [EOU] Never saw him really tight. [EOU] Luisa [SAYS] Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. [EOU] I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. [EOU] It's just every day that he tipples. [EOU] Leu [SAYS] As if slowly killing himself with liquor. [EOU] Luisa [SAYS] He doesn't care. [EOU] He says he's got his life behind him. [EOU] Leu [SAYS] But it is terrible. [EOU] How can you cope with it? [EOU] Luisa [SAYS] I stopped to care too. [EOU] It is his life. [EOU] If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. [EOU] Look I cannot do anything about it. [EOU] What hide bottles? [EOU] Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day. [EOU] Leu [SAYS] Therapy? [EOU] Luisa [SAYS] Gimme a break! [EOU] Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! [EOU] I can't. [EOU] Leu [SAYS] Nor can I. [EOU] Luisa [SAYS] We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. [EOU] When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. [EOU] But then it was worse and worse... [EOU] Now it's too late. [EOU] Leu [SAYS] Poor Luisa, poor Bill. [EOU] It is so sad. [EOU] But you are tough Luisa. [EOU] You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say. [EOU] Luisa [SAYS] Yes, I am. [EOU] That keeps me sane. [EOU] I don't worry if I can't change it. [EOU] To a degree... [EOU] Leu [SAYS] Right you are! [EOU] "The beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different." Do you remember? [EOU] Luisa [SAYS] "Then the rocks are laid bare as the tide pulls away the sand. [EOU] Such is life." [EOU]

Lillianne [SAYS] My brother met a new girl online. [EOU] Alan [SAYS] Good for him. [EOU] The other one wasn’t that great. [EOU] Lillianne [SAYS] Indeed. [EOU] Maybe this one will be better. [EOU] Alan [SAYS] I hope. [EOU] Lillianne [SAYS] But he doesn’t know how to handle girls. [EOU] Alan [SAYS] Why? [EOU] What did he do? [EOU] Lillianne [SAYS] He only met her a few times and already gave her a super expensive gift. [EOU] Alan [SAYS] What??? [EOU] Lillianne [SAYS] He has money and he compensates other things like that [EOU] But deep inside he’s very insecure. [EOU] Alan [SAYS] That’s not a good start of any relationship [EOU] Maybe you should talk to him.

Steve [SAYS] hi, what do you think about this display? [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] Bill [SAYS] hi! [EOU] let me check [EOU] never had the chance to use it personally but the parameters looks fine [EOU] just remember that if you have a GeForce card it will not work with FreeSync. [EOU] Steve [SAYS] is that a problem? [EOU] Bill [SAYS] it will work as a display, you just won't be able to activate this technology [EOU] I did found something more worrying [EOU] there's lots of reviews about frequent bad pixels in this model and issues with the power supply. [EOU] Steve [SAYS] ok, thanks for the info [EOU] I found another one [EOU] <file_other> [EOU] Bill [SAYS] the reviews for this one look much better and the parameters are similar to the previous one [EOU] the only reported issue are faded colors but that's always a subjective matter [EOU] from those two I would definitely choose the second one. [EOU] Steve [SAYS] ok, great :) [EOU] I'll order it. [EOU] Bill [SAYS] I don't remember what card you have at the moment [EOU] so just make sure you'll be able to connect it properly.

[EOU] Jaimie [SAYS] IMO it's not even pizza anymore. [EOU] It's more like a pie. [EOU] Clive [SAYS] Hey, Jaimie, I remember you ordering Hawaiian pizza :P. [EOU] Jaimie [SAYS] Yup, I'm fine with pineapple, maybe even some cranberry, but only if there's also enough cheese and meat to counterbalance it. [EOU] Who the hell makes sweet pizza?

[EOU] Steven [SAYS] See, that's the spirit! [EOU] Harry [SAYS] Dad, Lesley simply has basketball in two hours and wants you to give her a lift :P. [EOU] Lesley [SAYS] You little snitch! [EOU] Steven [SAYS] Calm down, kids, no one leaves this house until we decide what to get Mum on her birthday. [EOU] Lesley [SAYS] But Dad! [EOU] Steven [SAYS] Don't “Dad” me. [EOU] Think!

Max [SAYS] Din anyone actually watch this the video? [EOU] <link_video> [EOU] Allen [SAYS] Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. [EOU] But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. [EOU] But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases. [EOU] Jeremy [SAYS] Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an "occasional low cumulative", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month. [EOU] Max [SAYS] Tom You didn’t watch the video. [EOU] Tom [SAYS] I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. [EOU] Thanks. [EOU] ;) [EOU] Jason [SAYS] I like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody I know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well. [EOU] Daniel [SAYS] Short attention span 😊 [EOU] Max [SAYS] Daniel probably from pot 🤷‍♂️ [EOU] Jason he does - rewatch the end man. [EOU] He doesn’t specifically say combing the two , but he says one usually precedes the other. [EOU] David [SAYS] Jason, I used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer, and I know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco. [EOU] Rawiri [SAYS] Jason Hollis yuck...why even??? [EOU] Tom [SAYS] I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint? [EOU] David [SAYS] I don’t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). [EOU] I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. [EOU] Some spliffs may be big some joints be small... [EOU] Ken [SAYS] Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues. [EOU] Tom [SAYS] BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. [EOU] Propaganda. [EOU] Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine. [EOU] Brian [SAYS] this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. [EOU] It's not saying cannabis is harmful... [EOU] there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates. [EOU] Ken [SAYS] Really? [EOU] Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. [EOU] oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it. [EOU] Mark [SAYS] Cannabis does not have a bad affect on the lungs!! [EOU] Virginia [SAYS] MJ users will not believe anything bad. [EOU] They think it is right up there with kale and swiss chard! [EOU]
Nora [SAYS] Hi mum, look at these photos. [EOU] Harper [SAYS] ?? [EOU] Nora [SAYS] they are loading. [EOU] Harper [SAYS] how? [EOU] Nora [SAYS] I am sending them but they haven't gone through to you.

[EOU] Nora [SAYS] JUST A SECOND MUM. [EOU] Harper [SAYS] Oh, there is something!! [EOU] It's blurred but I see it!! [EOU] Nora [SAYS] Try opening it. [EOU] Harper [SAYS] My pretty girl!!!

Gary [SAYS] Yo, did you see that brawl in front of a supermarket because of that Black Friday madness :P ? [EOU] Paul [SAYS] Black Friday? [EOU] Bro, we don’t live in the States haha. [EOU] What happened? [EOU] Gary [SAYS] That happened…<file_photo> The security wouldn’t open the mall until 9am and the crowd went out of control. [EOU] Paul [SAYS] Haha, that must have been funny and scary at the same time. [EOU] Also embarrassing. [EOU] Gary [SAYS] Yeah, I would never take part in such crap People go mad over a 10% discount on a TV, that had its price risen a week ago. [EOU] Paul [SAYS] Haha, that’s right. [EOU] I guess the only winners are those, who were smart enough not to do shopping today. [EOU] Gary [SAYS] Well said. [EOU] So, we going for a beer at 8pm? [EOU] Paul [SAYS] Yup, don’t come late, clown :) [EOU]

[EOU] i do look great :D [EOU] Natalie [SAYS] was it expensive? [EOU] Dylan [SAYS] not really considering that the barber not only took care of my hair and beard, but also removed my unibrow and hair on my nose. [EOU] Natalie [SAYS] hmm, could you try to convince Ian to go to a barber? [EOU] maybe he'd give it a go, if he saw the effect [EOU] i want him to get rid of his unibrow so bad... [EOU] Dylan [SAYS] i haven't notice, that he has one. [EOU] Natalie [SAYS] yes, he does and i absolutely hate it [EOU] so, could you talk to him? [EOU] Dylan [SAYS] erm, that would be awkward [EOU] 'dude, you need to do something with your eyebrows... [EOU] they look weird...' [EOU] i mean, come on. [EOU] Natalie [SAYS] ok,ok, i get it [EOU]

[EOU] Tom [SAYS] Not an expert on medal, but he got one for bravery in Vietnam, not sure how it's called. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] Isn't it the medal of honor? [EOU] Tom [SAYS] Nah, that's like the highest one you can get and it's awarded by the president. [EOU] He got something else. [EOU] Rod [SAYS] Purple Heart? [EOU] Tom [SAYS] yeah, he got that, but that's cause he died in combat. [EOU] Either way it's a cool addition to the project. [EOU] Jake [SAYS] true [EOU]

George [SAYS] You coming out for a few rounds this Friday night? [EOU] John [SAYS] I wish I could mate but the missus insists we must spend 'quality time' together. [EOU] Family responsibilities and all that. [EOU] George [SAYS] I understand but it would be good if she let you out now and again to have a few beers with your mates. [EOU] John [SAYS] Yeah it would. [EOU] George [SAYS] How is the family life going? [EOU] John [SAYS] Could be better. [EOU] George [SAYS] Meaning...? [EOU] John [SAYS] Missus wants me to spend more time with the kids and to spend time with her. [EOU] It's either one or the other since I can't see how I can do both. [EOU] So we end up fighting the whole time. [EOU] Thought that this is family time thing is supposed to be fun instead it is stressful and annoying. [EOU] Sometimes I think that I'm not cut out for the family life. [EOU] George [SAYS] Sounds like you're not really enjoying it. [EOU] I can fully relate. [EOU] This is why I stay single and made sure to get the snip. [EOU] John [SAYS] Don't get me wrong I DO love my kids but all the extra pressure from the wife doesn't help. [EOU] She doesn't know what she bloody wants. [EOU] Whatever I do is not good enough. [EOU] Can't win. [EOU] Ugh! [EOU] George [SAYS] Women! [EOU] I could never work them out! [EOU] John [SAYS] I thought I could but now I'm not so sure. [EOU] George [SAYS] Maybe a break on Friday night might be a good idea. [EOU] Help you to clear your head. [EOU] John [SAYS] Yeah, I think you're right... [EOU] I'll think about it. [EOU] George [SAYS] Right-O! [EOU] Let me know when you decide. [EOU] Hopefully catch up with you on Friday night. [EOU]

[EOU] Anna [SAYS] Never read it. [EOU] What's it about? [EOU] Mark [SAYS] Srsly?! [EOU] That's one of my faves. [EOU] Mat [SAYS] It's an adventure novel based in the 19th century. [EOU] Napoleonic times I think. [EOU] Anna [SAYS] Ah... [EOU] It's old. [EOU] I don't like such books. [EOU] I prefer something about love and passion. [EOU] Mark [SAYS] There's a lot of that in this book ;) [EOU] Anna [SAYS] Rly? [EOU] Mat [SAYS] Oh sure! [EOU] The main character is falsely accused of something a couple of days before getting married. [EOU] Anna [SAYS] And then what happens? [EOU] Mark [SAYS] He gets thrown into jail and plots revenge on the ppl who destroyed his happiness! [EOU] Anna [SAYS] Oh my! [EOU] That's interesting! [EOU] I'll have to read it someday! [EOU]

[EOU] Sam [SAYS] we stayed in a little longer [EOU] and then went to a club. [EOU] Dean [SAYS] which one? [EOU] Sam [SAYS] club 55? [EOU] Dean [SAYS] it is wild :D [EOU] Sam [SAYS] Amanda left after 20 minutes with some guy who looked exactly like her ex whom she claims she's over.

Alan [SAYS] Hi there! [EOU] :) [EOU] John [SAYS] Hi, what's up? [EOU] Alan [SAYS] Nothing much. [EOU] I've heard you and Tim were apartment hunting the other day :) You guys moving together? [EOU] :) [EOU] John [SAYS] Lol, no :D [EOU] He just lives super close and I thought it was a cool idea to have someone else to go with me :) [EOU] The lady who owns the place actually have us a strange look :) She looked super old fashioned so you know what she must have been thinking :D [EOU] Alan [SAYS] Yeah, I can imagine :) [EOU] John [SAYS] And we thought it would be funny not to explain anything. [EOU] But she actually was very polite and never said anything. [EOU] Alan [SAYS] That's a good sign actually :) [EOU] John [SAYS] Well, the flat is a typical rental, so she must have seen some stuff :) [EOU] Alan [SAYS] Yeah, I can imagine :) [EOU] Anyway, how's the apartment? [EOU] John [SAYS] Well, decent would be the best word to describe it. [EOU] the rooms are old, haven't been renovated in quite some time [EOU] The kitchen is OK - no luxurious stuff but quite nice looking. [EOU] And there is a dishwasher :) [EOU] Alan [SAYS] Always a plus - I can't imagine living without one now :) [EOU] John [SAYS] The bathroom has been renovated recently - so it's new and in this kind of rental-basic style [EOU] In general, if I were buying it for myself it would need a serious overhaul, but as a rental should be ok. [EOU] Alan [SAYS] So what's stopping you? [EOU] You don't seem all that enthusiastic. [EOU] John [SAYS] The rent is rather high so I would expect a bit more for that money. [EOU] Alan [SAYS] Well, then try to negotiate, if she's been renting it already for some time then she knows the game :) You always set the price higher in case you find someone who would be willing to pay it :) [EOU] John [SAYS] Yeah, that's a good idea. [EOU] Alan [SAYS] And let me know how it went. [EOU] Would be good to have all the gang closer :) [EOU] John [SAYS] yeah, that would be cool :) Will let you know! [EOU]  [EOU]
James [SAYS] I’m going to see a game after work. [EOU] Mary [SAYS] Ok. [EOU] We will leave you some food for later. [EOU] Patrick [SAYS] I'm also going to see the game! [EOU] James [SAYS] I'll be in Granta. [EOU] Patrick [SAYS] Me too! [EOU]

[EOU] Doris [SAYS] We don't know, but there is also sign of an injury a long while ago. [EOU] It worries me that there was no warning.

[EOU] Doris [SAYS] Dunno yet. [EOU] Her condition is stable. [EOU] She's got her husband and 3 children around her. [EOU] But I may go and stay with her when she's back home. [EOU] Jill [SAYS] To help with the household? [EOU] Doris [SAYS] Exactly. [EOU] But it may be that they'll first send her for recuperation somewhere. [EOU] Jill [SAYS] They usually do after a serious operation, don't they? [EOU] Doris [SAYS] That would be very good for her indeed. [EOU] Also mentally. [EOU] She's strong but her body may need a rest. [EOU] We'll see! [EOU] Jill [SAYS] I'll keep fingers crossed for you! [EOU] Both of you. [EOU] Doris [SAYS] Thx Jill.

Ashley [SAYS] This one is mostly for the ladies (but certainly open to the men of the tribe, too!!).....Some of us had talked about an eyebrow skillshare and since I plan to reshape and dye/tint my eyebrows in the next few days, it seems like the perfect time to get moving on this. [EOU] We can discuss eyebrow/face geometry, brow mapping, how to tint/dye them (should you wish to, I have brown and black dye with me and I welcome you to use it), and how to fill them in with makeup. [EOU] Let me know if you would like to join! [EOU] Gerardo [SAYS] Yall can clean my eyebrows if u need a pair to practice on. [EOU] Ashley [SAYS] If you are curious how my passion for eyebrows began, it was because I was formerly the program manager overseeing the implementation of a program designed to help individuals going through cancer regain self-confidence through beauty techniques - with a heavy emphasis on drawing on new eyebrows. [EOU] <file_link> [EOU] Anna [SAYS] <file_gif> [EOU] Ashley [SAYS] Gery, fully expect you to attend this skillshare now that you have offered yourself up.

Gita [SAYS] Hello, this is Beti's Mum Gita, I wanted to ask if you were going on the school trip? [EOU] Bev [SAYS] Hi Gita, yes, Milo wants me to come, he's a bit nervous going away from home or school still. [EOU] Gita [SAYS] Yes, Beti is the same, they are still only 4 or 5 after all. [EOU] Bev [SAYS] I know, still so young! [EOU] It will help the teachers and TAs anyway, they have a lot to cope with! [EOU] Gita [SAYS] I know, I could never do their job!

[EOU] Gita [SAYS] Yes, it really helps to do some sort of work doesn't it! [EOU] I could never manage full time, though. [EOU] Bev [SAYS] Oh, I know, Gita. [EOU] My sister's in management and she doesn't see her kids from 6.30am to 6.30pm every day! [EOU] She is a high flier, but she does miss them. [EOU] She does do lots with them on the weekend, though. [EOU] Gita [SAYS] Yes, but children need time to just be at home and play or just be with family, not galavanting around all the time! [EOU] Bev [SAYS] I agree 100%! [EOU] Is Beti looking forward to feeding the lambs and seeing the baby animals on the farm, Milo is very excited. [EOU] Gita [SAYS] Oh yes!

[EOU] What time do we have to be at school on Wednesday? [EOU] Bev [SAYS] Quite early, I think about 7.45, the bus leaves at 8 and we get to Holly Farm about 10, I think. [EOU] Gita [SAYS] Hope the rain keeps off, especially if it's outdoors. [EOU] I'll check their website. [EOU] Bev [SAYS] Yes, good idea. [EOU] Anyway, see you Weds, Gita! [EOU] Gita [SAYS] Bye, Bev!
